        "content": "You\u2019ve probably heard of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), but how about premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD)? Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the condition, from the symptoms to look out for to the treatment options available. Key takeaways Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a more severe form of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). PMDD causes debilitating emotional symptoms that begin before your period and go away shortly after it starts. Your health care provider might ask you to track your symptoms for a few months to diagnose you with PMDD. There\u2019s no one-size-fits-all treatment for PMDD, but some options include antidepressants, therapy, or hormonal medications. PMDD: What is it? Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD)is a more severe form of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). While both PMDD and PMS can causephysical and emotional symptoms, such as headaches, bloating, and disruption to sleep, PMDD has abigger impact on someone\u2019s mood. This can understandably get in the way of your daily life, like work, school, or relationships, and lead toextreme anxiety or depression. For this reason, the DSM-5 \u2014 the manual used to categorize and diagnose mental health disorders \u2014 lists PMDD as a \u201cdepressive disorder.\u201d This might sound scary, but rest assured that help and treatment are available. We\u2019ve got more information below. What causes PMDD? How common is it? PMDD affects around3% to 8% of women. While we don\u2019t know exactly what causes it, experts think PMDD might be related to anincreased sensitivityto fluctuatinghormonesduring the menstrual cycle. Someresearchalso suggests that there could be a genetic component. PMDD symptoms Symptoms of PMDD usually show up inthe week before your periodbefore going away a few days after it begins. As we\u2019ve seen, the symptoms of PMDD can beso disruptivethat they make working, socializing, and having healthy relationships difficult. It\u2019s also important to note that while PMDD is characterized by emotional symptoms, people may also experience some of the physical symptoms of PMS alongside these. Emotional symptoms Severe emotional symptoms are usually what marks PMDD as being different from PMS. These includeat least oneof the following: Tension or anxiety A feeling of hopelessness or sadness Extreme mood swings Noticeable irritability or anger Physical symptoms The physical symptoms of PMDD can sometimes mirror those of PMS andinclude thingslike: Bloating Cramping Headaches Breast tenderness This isn\u2019t an exhaustive list; for more information on the physical symptoms of PMS that could also be present with PMDD, clickhere. Disorders that look like PMDD Identifying PMDD can be tricky, as it sharessimilar symptoms with other conditions, such asdepression,anxiety,and thyroid disorders. So, it\u2019s important to speak with your health care provider for an official diagnosis. PMDD risk factors PMDD is still fairly misunderstood and under researched, but some things that have been shown to increase therisk of developing PMDDinclude: Having experienced traumatic events in the past, as well as preexisting anxiety disorders Smoking cigarettes Having a BMI of 27.5 or higher That being said, it\u2019s important to remember that while these factors could be connected to PMDD, researchers are still working to understand this condition better. PMDD complications Dealing with PMDD can be incredibly challenging, and without treatment, it canlead to depression. In some very severe cases, it could alsolead to suicidal thoughts. With this in mind, it\u2019s important to reach out to your health care provider for advice, assessment, and treatment if you think you might be living with the condition. And don\u2019t be afraid to ask your loved ones for all the support you need, too. There are also some national helplines you can contact for support, advice, or just a chat. They\u2019re available 24/7, every day of the week. If you\u2019re experiencing suicidal thoughts and you live in the United States, you can text or call theSuicide and Crisis Lifelineat 988. If you live in the United Kingdom, you can callThe Samaritansat 116 123. You can also see more options for supporthere. PMDD Diagnosis As with PMS, there\u2019sno single testthat providers use to diagnose PMDD. However, don\u2019t let that discourage you from seeking help. If your symptoms are having an impact on your daily life, schedule a visit with your health care provider for help and support. Potential criteria for diagnosis To be diagnosed with PMDD, a doctor will be looking for you to fita number of criteria. First, you must have experienced five or more of the following symptoms during most menstrual cycles over the course of a year (and the emotional symptoms must have resolved when your period began): Anger or irritability Depression Problems concentrating Either needing more sleep or struggling to sleep Mood swings Increased appetite Loss of interest in your usual activities A feeling of being overwhelmed Physical symptoms such as bloating, headaches, and breast tenderness In addition, your doctor will be looking for symptoms that disrupt your normal work or social life and are not related to (or enhanced by) any other medical conditions. There\u2019s no doubt that getting a PMDD diagnosis can betime-consuming and frustrating, but one thing that helps is tracking your symptoms. Keeping a detailed record of your symptoms each month can make it easier to advocate for yourself and be diagnosed. You can use anapp like Floto do this. PMDD treatments options and therapies There is no one-size-fits-all treatment for PMDD, so your health care provider might recommend targeting the symptoms that affect you the most. Currently,management for PMDDincludes: Lifestyle changes, such as decreasing the amount of sugar, salt, caffeine, and alcohol in your diet and getting regular exercise Antidepressantscalled selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)and/or therapy to manage PMDD symptoms like depression, anxiety, and mood swings Hormonal birth control orgonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)injections to suppress hormonal fluctuations caused by your cycle Pain relief medication for physical symptoms like cramps and sore breasts Can you prevent PMDD? If you already have anxiety or depression, then treating these conditions couldhelp to preventthe symptoms of PMS from becoming more severe. If you don\u2019t already have these conditions and your PMDD is caused by hormones or genetics, then it might not be possible to prevent it. But that doesn\u2019t mean you have to suffer in silence. You can make the condition easier to live with by making some lifestyle tweaks (more on those in a minute) or receiving treatment as described above. Tips for living with and managing PMDD PMDD can be a challenging condition to manage, but there are some things you can try that might help reduce the impact PMDD has on your daily life. As we saw above, your doctor may suggest somelifestyle changes, particularly in the weeks leading up to your period. These changes can include: Exercising regularly Eating a balanced diet (with plenty of protein and carbohydrates) Cutting back on caffeine, alcohol, sugar, and salt Managing stress, for example, with meditation or yoga Making these changes isn\u2019t going to cure PMDD, but practicing self-care could make a positive difference and make your symptoms more manageable. Taking care of your emotional well-being when dealing with PMDD is equally important. You might find it helpful to reach out to a therapist or an organization that provides peer support and advice tailored to PMDD. When should you see a doctor? It\u2019s totally normal to experience some emotional and physical discomfort in the days leading up to your period. However, if these symptoms are impacting your work, family, or relationships or if you feeldepressed or have suicidal thoughts, you should always reach out to your health care provider. What can you expect from your appointment? If you\u2019re concerned that you might have PMDD, your health care provider will want to understand your overall health. This might include asking you about yourmental and physical health historyanddoing a pelvic examto rule out any other medical conditions. To help with the diagnosis, your doctor might also ask you torecord your mood and physical symptomsdaily for a number of months. It\u2019s completely normal to feel nervous during appointments. If you ever feel uneasy, you have the right to bring along someone you trust to support you and help you speak up for yourself."

If you'd like to read this piece in Ukrainian\u00a0then you can do so for free in the Flo app. Inhumanitarian disasters, women and people who menstruate might not havethe necessary itemsto manage their periods safely. It\u2019s hard to plan ahead if you need to leave your home in a hurry. And you might not be able to carry your usual items. Your period can create extra worry during an already traumatic time. Here\u2019s some helpful advice from Dr. Maria Corniero, an OB-GYN (obstetrician and gynecologist) who works with M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (aka Doctors Without Borders), a humanitarian medical organization that helps people in conflict zones. DIY menstrual pads: How to make your own pads If you don\u2019t have pads ortampons, it\u2019s actually easier than you might think to make your own reusable pad. \u201cTake advantage of an old clean cotton T-shirt (or any cotton material),\u201d suggests Dr. Corniero. Simply cut out a few strips and layer them in your underwear. Cotton is the best material for DIY pads because it\u2019s a natural, breathable fabric, she adds.Synthetic fibers, such as polyester and lace, can irritate the delicate skin around your genitals \u2014 and make vaginal infections more likely. Change your homemade pad every 4 to 8 hours, depending on the amount of bleeding, Dr. Corniero advises. And before reusing, clean it with water (ideally hot water) and soap. The pad might still look stained afterward, but that\u2019s normal. Just be sure to wash the pad until the water runs clear. Hydrogen peroxide is also an ideal cleaning solution if you have it. Don\u2019t use harsh chemicals such as chlorine bleach or lye (aka caustic soda), she adds. If you have a sewing kit and an old towel,check out this template from the nonprofit Action Aidfor more detailed instructions (with easy-to-follow pictures anda video) for making a reusable pad. DIY menstrual pads: Use a menstrual cup If you don\u2019t want to go down the DIY route, the best alternative for single-use period products is amenstrual cup, says Dr. Corniero. \u201cYou can clean it easily and use it again and again.\u201d But she acknowledges that even if you\u2019re a regular menstrual cup user, you might not have one with you at the moment. A menstrual cup can be worn for up to 12 hours at a time. In comparison,pads and tampons must be changed several times a day. What\u2019s more,menstrual cups collect three times as much fluid as a tampon, meaning they\u2019re less likely to leak than other period products. DIY menstrual pads: DIY period products to avoid Women and people who menstruate who don\u2019t have period productssometimes use tissues or paper towels as DIY pads. Even in an emergency situation, these replacements are a bad idea \u2014 and not just because they\u2019re uncomfortable.Such methods might put you at a heightened risk of vaginal infections, such asbacterial vaginosis, and vulvar contact dermatitis (aka itching and rashes of the vulva). Avoid DIY tampons too, says Dr. Corniero. Items that aren\u2019t designed to be safely used in your vagina might increase the risk of infection. If you are using regular disposable tampons, remember to change them frequently. \u201cIn times of crisis, I could imagine that you\u2019d forget about it for days, which can be very dangerous,\u201d says Dr. Corniero. You should change your tampon every 4 to 8 hours. Going too long between changing one can increase the risk of vaginal infections. This includes a rare but life-threatening condition calledtoxic shock syndromewhere bacteria gets into the body and releases harmful toxins. DIY menstrual pads: How to manage period pain without medicine Pads might not be the only thing on your mind when managing your period during turbulent times. What if you experiencepainful cramps? During a crisis, accessing medicine\u00a0\u2014\u00a0even simple painkillers \u00a0\u2014\u00a0can be a challenge. To handle cramps without medication, \u201capply heat to the affected area,\u201d says Dr. Corniero. A hot water bottle or heat pad is ideal if you\u2019re able to find one. Self-massage for cramps You could also lightly massage your lower abdomen using circular motions. Try the following steps: Lie on your back. Rub your hands together to warm them. Overlap your hands on the lower part of your belly. Use your palms to massage the entire stomach area in a clockwise direction. Continue the same movement on the left side of your stomach, in one-inch intervals, moving downward. Do the same on the right side of your belly. Use your fingers to press your navel firmly. Circulating outward from your navel, continue in a clockwise, circular motion. If you have trigger points that need extra attention, go ahead and focus on them. DIY menstrual pads: Keeping clean on your period If you\u2019re away from home without access to your usual toiletries, you might also worry about staying clean. How do you keep your genitals hygienic, especially when you\u2019re on your period? Dr. Corniero assures that all you need is clean water to clean your vulva (the outside of your genitals). \u201cUse only water for hygiene,\u201d says Dr. Corniero. \u201cIt is not necessary to use special soaps.\u201d Your vagina (the inside part) is self-cleaning, so you don\u2019t need to include it in your bathing routine. DIY menstrual pads: Stress and period Finally, it\u2019s worth knowing that it is not uncommon foran acutely stressful situation like this to impact your period. So don\u2019t be alarmed if you notice a change, such as longer or shorter cycles. \u201cIt\u2019s very normal to miss a period in times of stress,\u201d says Dr. Corniero. \u201cThis is temporary most of the time, and normal bleeding should resume when you go back to a normal routine.\u201d"

If you'd like to read this piece in Ukrainian\u00a0then you can do so for free in the Flo app. Most people know that stress can have a powerful impact on their mental health. But did you know it can also have a significant effect on yourphysicalhealth too? Yeah, it really does. And this includesour menstrual cycles, too. You may notice stress changes your period. Maybe it comes early,doesn\u2019t show up at all, or your cramps are more painful. We spoke to OB-GYN (obstetrician and gynecologist)Dr. Barbara Levyto learn why and how stress can alter your cycle. She also explains when your cycle might return to normal and how to minimize stress. Stress and period: How can stress mess with your period? Here are some of the changes you might notice: A delayed period An early period A missed period A more painful period Worse PMS (premenstrual syndrome) Stress and period: Why does this happen? These changes could be caused by emotional or physical stress (or both).It could be because you haven\u2019t slept or eaten enough or because you\u2019re physically exhausted, worried, or overwhelmed.And it\u2019s these stressors that can affect your brain chemistry. When you\u2019re stressed, your body releases a hormone called cortisol. High levels of cortisol make the hypothalamus (the part of your brain that controls your menstrual cycle) stop ovulation in its tracks. As ovulation is key to having a period, this can affect when \u2014 and if \u2014 your period starts. We don\u2019t knowwhy, but everyone reacts differently to stress. Some people will notice these changes immediately. For others, they may take longer to kick in. And some people might never notice a physical response to stress at all. And as some people are more sensitive to stress than others, it\u2019s impossible to predict which kinds of stress (short term, long term, mild, moderate, severe) will lead to a change in your cycle. However, wedoknow that people withanxiety and depressionare more likely to be stressed. Stress and period: When will your cycle return to normal? These changes shouldn\u2019t be long term. \u201cTypically, once we stop producing large amounts of the stress hormones, the changes will resolve,\u201d Dr. Levy explains. She adds that most people\u2019s periods will return to normal within one cycle after the stressors are gone. Stress and period: What can you do if stress is impacting your cycle? \u201cMy advice is to learn techniques for managing our response to stress, rather than trying to eliminate those things that stress us,\u201d Dr. Levy says. \u201cSome people can\u2019tescape their stress. We can manage ourselves far better than controlling our environment or other people.\u201d These techniques can help limit your body\u2019s release of stress hormones: Breathing exercises. You can try this simple calming breathing technique that can be done standing, sitting, or lying down. Whichever position you\u2019re in, place your feet hip-width apart. Breathe in gently through your nose, letting your breath flow into your stomach as deep as is comfortable. You may find it helpful to count from one to five as you breathe in. (If you can\u2019t reach five at first, that\u2019s OK!) Breathe out gently and count to five again. Repeat this for three to five minutes. Mindfulness meditation. This technique is all about tuning in to \u2014 and being aware of \u2014 the present moment. And you can practice it anywhere, whether you\u2019re sitting still or on the move. Wherever you are, try being quiet while paying attention to how your body feels as you breathe in and out, the sounds around you, and what you can smell or taste. If your mind wanders or gets lost in thought, gently bring your attention back to the present. It can be helpful to do this exercise at the same time every day. You could also try: Stretching Connecting with others and talking about how you\u2019re feeling Taking breaks from news stories Sticking to a sleep schedule, where you go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, as much as possible under the circumstances Moving more and sitting less, even if you are in a limited area Avoiding smoking Limiting how much alcohol you drink Avoiding using drugs/substances in ways other than prescribed When and if possible, contact a health care professional if the changes last for more than one cycle. \u201cYou may think stress is causing the change, but other medical conditions should be ruled out,\u201d Dr. Levy says. Besides your periods, long-term stress can lead to other serious health conditions, including high blood pressure, prediabetes, and obesity, if left untreated. Less frequently, it\u2019s possible to develop a condition calledpost-traumatic stress. This can mimic similar episodes in the future and may require specialized medical assistance. Stress and period: The takeaway Remember \u201cstress is a part of being alive, and our bodies are well protected from most of the short-term impacts of stress \u2014 including weird periods,\u201d Dr. Levy adds. \u201cThat said, anyone who feels overwhelmed, out of control, or unable to function should seek medical help [when and] if they are able to.\u201d"

        "publication_date": "Updated19 January 2023|",
        "content": "As the name suggests, cervical cancer occurs whencancerous cells grow in the cervix. It\u2019s thefourth most commontype of cancer in women, and it\u2019s classified in four different stages depending on how much it\u2019s spread to other parts of the body. You might have heard of your cervix but not be totally surewhere it is. It\u2019s the small, round, firmpassageway that connectsthe bottom of your uterus to your vagina. Over the last couple of decades, medical professionals have worked tirelessly to raise awareness of thepreventative measuresyou can take against cervical cancer. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that more thannine of every tencases of cervical cancer are caused by human papillomavirus infection (HPV), so attendingyour pap smearand having the HPV vaccine could be life-saving. \u201cCervical cancer, while we have certainly come a long way in reducing incidence and mortality over the past few decades, still requires our full attention,\u201d saysDr. Angela Jones, board-certified obstetrics and gynecology expert. \u201cIn accordance with theAmerican Cancer Society, approximately 14,100 new cases of invasive cervical cancer will be diagnosed, and roughly 4,280 women will die from cervical cancer in the United States in 2022.\u201d Below, Dr. Jones explains how the different stages of cervical cancer are classified, plus when and how to book regular pap smears. What are the four stages of cervical cancer? Any cancer diagnosis is difficult to deal with. You might feel scared, alone, or unsure about who you can speak to. That\u2019s OK. Know that there are lots of places you can go for support. Learning more about the type of cancer you have been diagnosed with can help you feel more in control of your treatment options and may help you to recognize any symptoms. So let\u2019s start by finding out the facts about cervical cancer. Cancer is named after the place in the body where it started. So, even if it spreads, cervical cancer describes cancer that begins in the cervix. It\u2019s one of five gynecological cancers. There arefour main stagesof cervical cancer. Stage one is the least severe, and four indicates that the cancer has spread to other parts of the body like the bones, lungs, and kidneys. This stage is also described as metastatic cancer. Wrapping your head around each of the cervical cancer stages can be confusing. However, your health care provider will be able to explain all the characteristics of each stage, including the size and depth of the cancer and if it\u2019s spread to any of your other reproductive organs or anywhere else in your body. Each stage is categorized by some key features: Stage 4: In stage 4, cervical cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the bladder, bones, liver, or lungs. This is the most advanced stage of cervical cancer. What are the symptoms of cervical cancer in the early stages? Cervical cancer symptomsmay be different for each person and often depend on how far the cancer has progressed. \u201cEarly-stage cervical cancer may have few to no symptoms, which is why screening is so important,\u201d says Dr. Jones. To learn more about what exactly happens at your pap smear appointment, then keep reading. Dr. Jones explains that advanced cervical cancer symptoms may include: Bleeding after sex Unusually long and heavy periods Bleeding between periods Bleeding that occurs after menopause Watery, bloodyvaginal discharge Vaginal discharge with an odor Pelvic pain Pain during sex It\u2019s really important to note that if you experience any of these symptoms, you shouldn\u2019t automatically assume that you have cervical cancer. You may experience these symptoms for a multitude of reasons, so try not to worry if you notice a change. What\u2019s important is to speak to your health care provider as soon as possible. How is cervical cancer diagnosed? To get to the bottom of the symptoms you might be experiencing, your medical professional may ask you about your medical history and run a series of tests. To assess any pains or abnormal bleeding, they may do an internal examination using a speculum. They will first examine your vulva. Then, using the speculum, they will look at your cervix. If at any point before or during your examination you feel any pain or are uncomfortable, you are well within your right to ask your health care provider to stop or to explain what they\u2019re doing and why. They might also conducta pap smearat the same time. Using a swab, they will take a sample of cells from your cervix to test for any abnormal changes. The pap smear can be used to test for human papillomavirus (HPV). If they notice any abnormalities, then they mayrecommend that you have a colposcopy. A colposcope is an instrument that has magnifying lenses and allows them to see the cervix in detail. A special solution is usually applied to the cervix to show abnormal areas. During the procedure, it is possible to take a piece of cervical tissue for examination \u2014 a biopsy. This means you\u2019ll have a small amount of tissue removed from your cervix to be examined under a microscope. How is cervical cancer treated? Treating cervical cancer isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all approach.Treatment optionsvary depending on the stage of cervical cancer, as well as other factors like age, overall health, and your personal preferences. While your health care provider will take all these things into consideration before presenting you with treatment options, you should also be given the opportunity to ask questions about how treatment could impact your sex life, your ability to have children, and if it will trigger early menopause. The most common treatment options include: Surgery:Surgery is often used to remove cervical cancer.If the cancer is very small, then you may opt to have part of your cervix removed. If it\u2019s larger, then you may have the cervix and part of the vagina removed. And if the cancer has spread further, then you may have your cervix and uterus removed. This is known as a hysterectomy and means you will no longer be able to carry a pregnancy. Surgery is more common during the early stages of cancer (before it has spread outside of the pelvis). Radiation therapy: Radiation therapy uses high-energy X-rays to kill cancer cells. It\u2019s often used in combination with surgery to prevent the cancer from coming back. Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells. It may be given alone or in combination with radiation therapy and is common for all stages when the cancerous cells have spread outside the uterus. Chemotherapy may also be used before surgery to shrink the cancer. Common chemotherapy drugs include cisplatin, carboplatin, or a combination of cisplatin and fluorouracil. Targeted therapy: Targeted therapy is a newer type of cancer treatment that uses drugs or other substances to target and kill cancer cells. It works by interfering with the way cancer cells grow and divide. Common targeted therapies for cervical cancer include bevacizumab (Avastin) and tisotumab vedotin-tftv (Tivdak). Immunotherapy: Immunotherapy is a type of targeted therapy that uses the body's immune system to fight cancer. It works by helping the body's immune system to recognize and kill cancer cells. Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) is an example of an immunotherapy drug used to treat cervical cancer. How can cervical cancer be prevented? They say prevention is better than a cure, and luckily, cervical cancer screenings can detect precancerous cells early \u2014 when they\u2019re most treatable. Dr. Jones recommends following the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG)cervical cancer screening guidelines: The regularity and timing of your pap test can vary depending on where you live. In the US, you will be invited for your first pap smear after you turn 21. In the UK, you\u2019ll have your first screening around the age of 25. If you\u2019ve had anabnormal pap smearin the past, you may be invited to have screenings more frequently, and you can begin to have annual wellness visits with your gynecologist once you\u2019re 18. They will be able to advise you on when to come in for your first pap smear and what will happen. Screenings are important, but they\u2019re not the only way to prevent cervical cancer. \u201cLifestyle modifications such as not smoking and practicing safe sex are also helpful in reducing risks,\u201d explains Dr. Jones, who adds that theHPV vaccinecan also help prevent cervical cancer. Cervical cancer vaccine: How does it work? The cervical cancer vaccine works by protecting against HPV (the virus that can cause cervical cancer). It does this by stimulating the body to produce antibodies against the virus. According to the National Cancer Institute, the HPV vaccine is most effective if you have it before you have sex for the first time. This is because HPV is usually spread through sexual contact. However, the HPV vaccine is still effective if you\u2019re already sexually active. It\u2019s given as a series of two to three shots, depending on age. The shots are usually given at least six months apart. TheHPV vaccine is availableat most health care provider offices, as well as community health centers, pharmacies, and some schools. Speak to your health care provider for more information on where you can get vaccinated. Cervical cancer: The takeaway As with any type of cancer, prevention and early detection make a world of difference. But it\u2019s also important to remember that cervical cancer is treatable \u2014 and there are many treatment options available. \u201cRegardless of which option you choose, ensuring that you are getting some sort of screening is key,\u201d Dr. Jones says. \u201cIn all my years of practice, one of the key things that most of the women I\u2019ve ever diagnosed with cervical cancer had in common was they hadn\u2019t had a pap smear in years.\u201d"

        "content": "If you\u2019re entering a new relationship with someone who hashuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or your current partner has just received a positive HIV diagnosis, you may be wondering what that means for you and your relationship. Whether it\u2019s a new relationship \u2014 or a new diagnosis \u2014 it\u2019s understandable to feel overwhelmed. You\u2019ll probably have lots of questions: How at risk are you ofinfection? Can youcontinue to have sex?And how can you best support your partner? The first thing to know is that HIV is an entirely manageable illness and by no means a death sentence for your love (orsex) life.The truth is many people who don\u2019t have HIV are in happy and healthy relationships with HIV-positive partners. This is referred to as a\u201cserodiscordant\u201d relationship. However, some people prefer to use the terms \u201cpositive\u2013negative,\u201d \u201cmixed-status,\u201d or \u201csero-divergent\u201d to describe their relationship. \u201cAny diagnosis can impact relationships,\u201d explains psychosexual and relationship therapistAoife Drury. \u201cWe all manage stress, worry, or anxiety in different ways, and often conflict tends to arise because of difficulties in expressing or identifying how we feel. Alongside this, specific to HIV, if there is a lack of understanding about the diagnosis, or if a stigma is being held, it can result in challenges within the dynamic. Hence the importance for couples to gain the correct information and educate themselves thoroughly to avoid myths impacting.\u201d By being informed about HIV, you can protect yourself from transmission while also helping your partner to stay healthy and feel supported and listened to. From using barrier protection during sex to taking preventive medication, below is everything you need to know about HIV prevention and what you can do to support your partner. What is HIV? Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)is a virus that targets CD4 cells or T-cells, a type of white blood cell that builds up your immune system. If someone\u2019s immune system is weakened by the virus, then it can make them more vulnerable to everyday diseases such as the flu. If you\u2019ve never had an HIVtest, then it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll never have been made aware of your CD4 cell count before.Your CD4 cell countis an indicator of your immune system function and can be checked by a simple blood test. Here\u2019s what the results of a CD4 cell count test mean: For a person who doesn\u2019t have HIV, the average CD4 cell count is between 600 and 1,500 per droplet of blood. If someone is HIV-positive and has a CD4 cell count of above 500, then that indicates that they are in good health. If someone is HIV-positive and has a CD4 cell count of below 200, then they\u2019re at a much greater risk of damage to their immune system and much more vulnerable to other diseases. It\u2019s best to speak to a health care provider immediately, in this case. HIV treatment can help to maintain and gradually increase the CD4 cell count. The most recent estimates suggest that1,189,700 people in the United Statesand106,890 people in the United Kingdomare living with HIV, but the annual number of new diagnoses is dropping. This may be partially due to greater access totesting, sexual healthand HIV services, and sex education. HIV has three stages: acute infection, chronic infection, and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Acute infection, also known as seroconversion illness, is the earliest stage of HIV. Some people may experience flu-like symptomstwo to four weeksafter being exposed to the virus, but this isn\u2019t the case for everyone. During the acute infection stage, the levels of HIV in the blood (also described as the viral load) are at their highest, meaning this is the stage when a person is most infectious. The lower the viral load in their bloodstream, the lower their risk of passing HIV on. Chronic infection HIV, also called asymptomatic HIV, can last several years. During this stage, someone may have no symptoms and feel completely fine, but the virus is still active, damaging CD4 white blood cells and impacting their immune system. AIDS is the most advanced stage of HIV, where the body\u2019s CD4 count is very low and the immune system struggles to fight the infection. People often confuse HIV with AIDS, but it\u2019s important to remember that if your partner has HIV, it does not mean they will inevitably get AIDS. Most people who receive a positive HIV diagnosis never experience AIDS. How is HIV transmitted? Sadly, there\u2019s still a lot of misinformation that surrounds how HIV is transmitted. So, if your partner has recently received a positive diagnosis, you may feel scared to ask questions for fear of coming across as insensitive. However, it\u2019s important to remember that you\u2019re in this together and can be a vital support. Your health care provider will be able to provide both you and your partner with any information you need and point you in the direction of support networks. These are the facts about HIV transmission: HIV ismost commonly passed onwhen you come into contact with semen(including pre-cum), vaginal fluids, breast milk, and blood. If these fluids contain HIV, the virus can be transmitted by entering an HIV-negative person via the mucous membrane of the vagina, rectum, mouth, or penis. HIV can also enter the bloodstream through open cuts. The most common way of contracting HIV is through unprotected sexual activity (including vaginal and anal sex). There is a verysmall risk of contracting HIVthrough oral sex, but the risk is very low. It can also be passed on by sharing needles with someone who is HIV-positive or receiving infected blood during a transfusion. Mothers can also pass HIV to their babies during pregnancy, birth, and breastfeeding, but medication candrastically reduce the risk of this happening. Let\u2019s bust some HIV transmission myths while we\u2019re here: The virus cannot be passed on by sharing saliva during kissing, sharing a toilet, sharing household items, or through coughing and sneezing. Symptoms of HIV Every person\u2019s HIV experience will be slightly different. Some people report flu-like symptoms within a couple of weeks of infection, while others don\u2019t have any symptoms at all. The most commonsymptoms of HIVinclude: Fever Chills Rash Night sweats Muscle and joint pain Diarrhea Sore throat Fatigue Swollen lymph nodes Mouth ulcers It\u2019s important to note that all of these symptoms are associated with other illnesses, like the flu. So if you notice a change in how you\u2019re feeling, speak to your doctor and try not to worry. They will do a blood test if there\u2019s a chance you may have contracted HIV. What is a HIV test? A HIV testis a blood test, which means a small sample of your blood will be tested to look for a protein found in HIV cells or HIV antibodies. It will either be taken with a finger prick or with a blood draw and then sent off to a lab for analysis. You should then receive your results that same day (in the case of a rapid test) or within a few days. Your health care provider may also offer you aurine test or a saliva test. You can get tested for HIV at a sexual health clinic, an HIV testing center, or at your health care provider\u2019s office. You can even self-test at home using a postal HIV test kit. Being open with your partner that you\u2019re going to do an HIV test, showing up to the clinic together, and asking questions can be a really small but significant way to show that you\u2019re there for them and want to support them from a place of love. Treatment for HIV Some good news: Treatment for HIV has developed monumentally over the last few decades. While there\u2019s no known cure at the moment, research is ongoing, and many HIV-positive people live long, happy lives. In fact, there are a number of treatment options available, so you can explore what\u2019s best for you. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the most commonly used medication for treating HIV. It involves taking a daily combination of HIV medications (HIV treatment regimen) in the form of pills. ART suppresses the virus by reducing the amount of it in the blood, referred to as the \u201cviral load.\u201d ART can also helpprevent HIV infection if your partner is HIV-negative. \u201cThese medications will increase your T-cell count in the process,\u201d explainsDr. Sameena Rahman, MD, an OB-GYN (obstetrician and gynecologist). \u201cThese meds help keep you healthy, reduce the chance of transmitting the virus to your loved ones, and reduce the chance of giving the virus to your unborn baby if you are pregnant.\u201d Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) \u200b\u200bAlthoughPrEP doesn\u2019t treat HIV,it\u2019s highly effective at preventing HIV transmission. This is known as \u201ctreatment as prevention.\u201d PrEP can be taken if you are HIV-negative and are in a relationship with someone who is HIV-positive. \u201cIf an HIV-negative person is in a relationship with an HIV-positive individual, they should take medications that may prevent the transmission while in the relationship, after first testing themselves and seeking advice from their clinician,\u201d says Dr. Rahman. PrEP isn\u2019t always necessary if you are in a monogamous relationship with an HIV-positive partner who has an undetectable viral load (the amount of HIV in the blood is so low it\u2019s undetectable), but Dr. Rahman explains that the preventive treatment has minimal side effects, so the benefits outweigh the risks. PrEP can be taken intwo different ways: one pill daily or only when needed, referred to as \u201con-demand\u201d or \u201cevent-based\u201d dosing. On-demand therapy isnot approved by the US Food and Drug Administrationcurrently and isn\u2019t recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Both methods have beenshown to be highly effective,but the use of \u201con-demand\u201d PrEP has, so far, only been studied in gay and bisexual men. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) PEP is a medicationtaken to prevent HIV after a possible exposure. It should be used only in emergency situations and has to be started within 72 hours of potential exposure to HIV. You can be prescribed PEP from the emergency room in the US. It might also be available at a sexual health clinic near you or some Planned Parenthood health centers. You should call your health care provider ahead of time to make sure they have PEP. In the UK, PEP is available for free from the National Health Service at a sexual health clinic, HIV clinic, and general practitioner\u2019s office. If you need to take PEP when clinics are closed, you can access it at the emergency department. ART, PrEP, and PEP are all highly effective treatments on their own, but there may be situations when you can combine methods for even more protection. If you or your partner want to explore a treatment plan, then you can speak to your health care provider about the options available to you, if they have any side effects, and how they might impact your sex life. What does U=U mean? One way to monitor viral load is to do frequent blood tests. This indicates how treatment is lowering the viral load in someone\u2019s bloodstream. If your partner\u2019s viral load is so low that it can\u2019t be measured, then they have what is known as an \u201cundetectable\u201d viral load. This doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ve been cured of HIV, but itdoesmean theycan\u2019t pass HIV onto someone elseeven when they have unprotected sex. This is what\u2019s known as U=U, or \u201cundetectable equals untransmittable.\u201d U=U may be reassuring for anyone who is HIV-positive and serodiscordant couples who might want to conceive or no longer want to use barrier protection (like condoms) during sex. And studies have shown just how effective it can be. In 2016, the landmarkPARTNER studylooked at 58,000 instances of unprotected sex in serodiscordant couples. It found that when an HIV-positive partner was on medication and had an undetectable viral load, there were zero cases of HIV transmission. This was confirmed in thePARTNER 2 study, published in 2019, which showed zero cases of HIV transmission among 782 gay male couples. There are two things to bear in mind here: Effective treatment is fundamental to U=U, and it can take up to six months after starting treatment for an HIV-positive person\u2019s viral load to become undetectable. So, it\u2019s important tokeep using barrier methods of protection like condomsduring that time. Remember too that if someone with an undetectable viral load stops HIV treatment, their viral load will increase and become detectable again. What to do if your partner has HIV Now that we know how HIV transmission, testing, and treatment work, let\u2019s dig deeper into the emotional side of an HIV diagnosis. Finding out that your partner has HIV doesn\u2019t have to mean an end to the relationship, nor does it mean sex is off the table. \u201cAn HIV diagnosis should not thwart a happy, healthy sex life. Many people who are in a serodiscordant relationship can have a fulfilling and thriving intimate sex life,\u201d says Drury. \u201cTry and make a conscious and deliberate effort to be open with each other and carve out time to be intimate,\u201d says Drury. \u201cSpend time discussing what you love about your sex lives, rather than focusing on the negatives. You can always reach out to a therapist if you need extra support \u2014 psychosexual therapists are trained to support couples with their sex lives.\u201d Keeping everyone in the relationship happy and healthy is a team effort, and all couples should understand that maintaining good sexual health is a shared responsibility. For serodiscordant couples, that might mean adopting prevention methods for the partner who is HIV-negative, supporting your HIV-positive partner, or both. You might consider taking PrEP. It\u2019s also key to use barrier protection like condoms and dental dams during sex. How can I help my HIV+ partner? Regardless of whether your partner has just been diagnosed or if they\u2019ve been living with HIV for a long time, there are plenty of things you can do to support them.Some researcheven shows that when supported by their significant other, a person with HIV is more likely to stay on track with their treatment. \u201cYour partner may be in shock or experience distress if they receive a HIV diagnosis,\u201d says Drury. \u201cIt's important to listen and be attentive and meet them without judgment, blame, or shame. Asking, \u2018How could I best support you right now?\u2019 can be very helpful, rather than assuming. Encourage them to get the support they need \u2014 be it medical, support groups, or therapy \u2014 and offer them help to attend appointments if they would like and where appropriate.\u201d Speaking to your health care provider and reading up about HIV treatment and prevention can help keep both you and your partner healthy and safe. However, it may also give you some of the tools to support your partner through their diagnosis. \u201cBeing present for them is key,\u201d adds Dr. Rahman. \u201cWhether that\u2019s being present at their doctor\u2019s appointments, helping them adhere to their medications, helping them understand the disease and that it is not a life sentence, [or] making sure to remind them of their appointments and follow-ups. Help them help themselves. So many HIV patients become depressed and scared; it\u2019s important to help alleviate those fears and anxiety.\u201d Living with a partner who is HIV-positive: The takeaway It\u2019s entirely possible to have a healthy relationship and a fulfilling sex life with a partner who is HIV-positive, without the risk of getting HIV yourself. Here are a few things you should keep in mind: Get tested for HIV regularly. Screening for HIV is the only way to be certain you haven\u2019t contracted the virus. This is especially important if your partner\u2019s viral load is still detectable. Consider PrEP. Although it\u2019s not required,PrEP can reduce your risk of contracting HIV by 99%. Use protection. Everyone who is sexually active should be using protection to prevent unplanned pregnancies or sexually transmitted infections, but in serodiscordant couples, barrier methods are especially important if your partner still has a detectable viral load or if you\u2019re nonmonogamous. Be there for your partner. An easy way to support a partner with HIV is by reminding them to take their meds. That way an HIV-positive person who is on ART and has an undetectable viral load can\u2019t transmit HIV to you or others."

        "content": "Being onyour perioddoesn\u2019t mean you have to put a pause onyour sex lifeif you don\u2019t want to. While you may want to consideryour periodby changing your sheets or protecting them with a towel, there are actuallysome benefits to getting intimateat this time in your cycle. Whether you want to make it a regular part of your sex life or not is a totally personal decision. So here\u2019s the lowdown on period sex, from how toapproach it with your partnerto why it mightalleviate some of your premenstrual symptoms. Key takeaways Period sex can be fun and is perfectly safe as long as you take the usualprecautions against pregnancyand sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Make sure you communicate with your partner beforehand so you both feel comfortable and ready to manage any blood. It can be normal for sex to feel a bit different while you\u2019re on your period. Experimenting with positions will help you find what works for you. Can you have sex on your period? If you and your partner are up forhaving period sex, there\u2019s no reason not to have it. It may still feel a little bit taboo, but it\u2019s thought that between3% and 30%of sexually active women choose to have period sex. But since there will be blood involved, is it safe? \u201cYes, it is safe to have sex during your menstrual cycle,\u201d saysDr. Renita White, obstetrician and gynecologist, Georgia Obstetrics and Gynecology, US. \u201cThough blood is present from the period, there is no risk of hurting yourself or your sexual partner.\u201d If you find yourself with a higher libido during your period, then this is great news. However, while sex on your period is perfectly safe, it\u2019s still important to remember thatyou can still get pregnantorcontract an STIat this point in your cycle, so youstill need to use contraception. If you aren\u2019t sure what the best type of birth control is for you,you can learn more here. So, let\u2019s take a look at some of the pros and cons of period sex more closely. Benefits of period sex Extra lubrication One bonus is that period blood may help reduce friction during penetrative sex. \u201cThe menstrual blood can serve as natural lubrication during intercourse,\u201d says Dr. White. This can make penetrative sex more enjoyable. Pain relief Dr. White explains that yourbody releases feel-good chemicalsduring sex called endorphins \u2014 one of thehealth benefits of sex. \u201cThe endorphins released during sex and orgasm may help improve menstrual cramp discomfort,\u201d she says. Heightened enjoyment Sex and your periodcan be a winning combination, because you may find sex is extra pleasurable this time of the month. \u201cSome people have a higher libido during menstruation, so they may enjoy having more sex, but it all depends on the person,\u201d says Dr. White. \u201cPlus, during menstruation, there is more blood flow to the uterus, pelvic floor, and vagina. This can increase sensitivity during sex. For some, it can make sex more enjoyable. But for others, it may cause more discomfort.\u201d So check in with how you\u2019re feeling and never feel pressured into doing anything you don\u2019t want to do. Possible consequences of period sex Mess When it comes to period sex, a little bit of mess comes with the territory. And this isn\u2019t something you or your partner should be scared of or grossed out by. Period blood is totally natural and safe. You may just want to take some extra steps when preparing and cleaning up afterward. \u201cSex during the menstrual cycle may be more messy than usual due to the blood that is present,\u201d says Dr. White. Whether you decide to protect your bedding with a towel or use an old or dark-colored set of sheets, there are lots of ways you can minimize cleanup time afterward. One thing you might want to consider is using amenstrual disc. This is a shallow disc made of plastic or silicone that you insert below your cervix in the vagina to collect period blood. Not only can it protect you from leaks forup to 12 hours, but you can keep it in during period sex. Unlike other menstrual products, menstrual discssit higher in the vaginal canaland are less likely to interfere with sex. STIs You can stillcatch STIsfrom period sex. \u201cIt\u2019s possible totransmit STIsany time during unprotected sex, whether on your period or not,\u201d says Dr. White. \u201cHowever, some viruses (like hepatitis) can live in blood. So there is a higher risk of transmission during your period.\u201d A couple of ways to ensure that both you and your partner are looking after your sexual health areattending STI screeningsif you\u2019ve had sex with someone new and always wearingbarrier protection like a condom or internal condom. If you\u2019re having oral sex, using adental damcan help to protect you against STIs. Pregnancy It\u2019s also possible toget pregnantif you have sex during your period. While it\u2019s less likely to happen now rather than atother points in your cycle, it\u2019s still really important to use birth control if you don\u2019t want to get pregnant. Tips for enjoyable period sex Whether you\u2019d rather do it in the shower, on a towel, or focus solely on oral sex, period sex can look different for everyone. However, sex should always be enjoyable, and both you and your partner should be on the same page with what you\u2019re comfortable with. If you aren\u2019t sure how to approach period sex, there are a few things you can consider. Communicate with your partner So much enjoyment in sex comes from communicating with your partner beforehand. Knowing what your partner likes and feels comfortable with can make sex so much better. Period sex is no exception to this. If you know you\u2019d like to have sex at this time in your cycle, then chat with your partner about it to make sure you\u2019re both on the same page. You\u2019ll feel more relaxed knowing that you\u2019re both excited to try it. Keep using contraception Period sex can feel new and exciting, but it\u2019s still important to take action againstcatching an STIorbecoming pregnantif you don\u2019t want to have a baby right now. Condoms are the only kind of birth control that canprotect you against STIs, and you might already be using a different type of contraception to avoid pregnancy. \u201cThough you\u2019re less likely to get pregnant on your period if you have a predictable menstrual cycle,it is not impossible,\u201d says Dr. White. \u201cSperm can live in the body for up to five days. So if you have unprotected sex during your period and ovulate shortly afterward, you would be able to get pregnant. Prepare yourself for a little mess The word mess has a lot of negative connotations, and there\u2019s still some stigma attached to period sex because there may be blood involved. The truth is your period is nothing to be ashamed of, and period blood is safe. However, for the sake of your favorite sheets, you might want to prepare for sex during this time in your cycle. You might choose to have sex in the shower, so any blood washes away. You could also put a large, dark-colored towel on your sheets to catch any blood. You could also use an old set of sheets to save wear and tear on your favorite linens. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in the moment, so try to remember to take any menstrual products out before having sex (unless you\u2019re using a menstrual disc). While you\u2019ll need to remove a tampon or menstrual cup before penetrative sex, some people choose to keep them in during foreplay. Remove your tampon or menstrual cup As things start to get heated, you might feel most comfortable keepingyour period productin until just before you have penetrative sex. If you decide that you\u2019d like to stick to oral sex during your period, then you can leave your tampon or menstrual cup in. However, Dr. White explains, \u201cIf a tampon or menstrual cup is in place during sex, it can prevent vaginal insertion for sex and make sex uncomfortable for you and your partner,\u201d says Dr. White. So don\u2019t be embarrassed if you need to make a quick dash to the bathroom to remove one of these items first. Try different positions Asyour hormones fluctuate during your period, it\u2019s typical to feel a little bit different, and what feels good at other points in your cycle may be painful or feel too intense. \u201cIf it is uncomfortable forthe cervixto be hit during sex due to menstrual cramps or being on your period, changing sexual positions to reposition your cervix and uterus can be helpful,\u201d says Dr. White. \u201cDepending on how you position your body, the cervix can sit higher or lower in the uterus. For example, bending forward may push the cervix farther away (higher in the vagina).\u201d Consider lying on your side and your partner entering you from a spooning position or straddling them so you can control the depth. Use a period tracker If you\u2019ve noticed changes to your sex drive or sensitivity while you\u2019re on your period, or at any time of the month for that matter, it can be useful and interesting to jot them down in a period tracker. Over time,tracking your cyclecan help you learn more about yourmenstrual cycleand when sex is most enjoyable for you. You can also use ourperiod calculatorto figure out when you\u2019re next due."

        "content": "Whether you\u2019ve noticed symptoms or have had unprotected sex, worrying about whether you\u2019ve got gonorrhea \u2014 or anysexually transmitted infection (STI)for that matter \u2014 can be very distressing. But even if you do have the infection, gonorrhea is one of themost common STIsand can be treated with asingle dose of medication. So, what does it feel like if you have it? Here, a Flo expert \u2014 and some members of Flo\u2019sSecret Chats(a safe space in our app to anonymously chat about health) who have had gonorrhea \u2014 share everything you need to know. Key takeaways Gonorrhea often doesn\u2019t have any obvious signs, with almost50% of womenhaving no symptoms at all. When they do appear, the mostcommon symptoms among womenare unusual discharge, pain when you\u2019re peeing, and abnormal vaginal bleeding, such as between periods orafter sex. It\u2019s important toget testedif you think someone may have given you gonorrhea. For many women, such as those who are under 25 or have more than one partner, health care providers recommend doing a screeningevery yearjust in case. What is gonorrhea?Symptoms of gonorrhea in women Gonorrhea is abacterial infectionof the genitals. However, the bacteria can also grow in yourmouth, throat, eyes, and anus, leading to symptoms in these areas, too. Often, gonorrheadoesn\u2019t cause any symptoms, especially for women. In fact, almosthalf of womenwith gonorrhea don\u2019t experience any signs of the infection. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to keep up withregular STI testing, as this Flo user\u2019s story illustrates: \u201cI\u2019m a freshman in college, and I just recently went in for an annual checkup,\u201d they explained on Secret Chats.\u201cTurns out I was infected with gonorrhea andchlamydia. I didn\u2019t have any symptoms, so I\u2019m glad I had my annual because it would have possibly gone unknown. The guy who gave it to me showed no symptoms either. He was just as shocked as me.\u201d If you do get gonorrhea symptoms, these usually start within10 daysof being infected, but they can also appear several months later. What does gonorrhea feel like? \u201cIf a woman does have symptoms, they tend to be vaginal or vulvar irritation or inflammation, or abnormalvaginal discharge,\u201d says Flo expertDr. Sara Twogood, obstetrician and gynecologist, Cedars-Sinai Medical Group, California, US. You may also noticepain when you pee. These symptomscan be mildand are often mistaken for a bladder or vaginal infection. \u201cThere can be some generalized discomfort in the pelvis,\u201d says Dr. Twogood. Sometimes gonorrhea can makesex feel differenttoo. If you get anyvaginal irritation, it can lead topainful sexor a feeling ofburning during sex. It\u2019s worth flagging that this can also be a symptom ofchlamydia, anothercommon STI. In fact, people often getgonorrhea and chlamydia together. What does gonorrhea look like? One of the key symptoms of gonorrhea that you can see is unusual vaginal discharge, which can look different in its: Consistency: discharge that\u2019sthin or watery Color: discharge that\u2019sgreen or yellow Tracking yourvaginal dischargewith an app like Flo can help you spot anything that doesn\u2019t seem right. It can be worrying to spot strange discharge, but the better you know your body, the faster you can act. Take this Flo user\u2019s story, for example: \u201cA day or two after having sex without a condom, I started seeing green discharge, and I knew it wasn\u2019t normal,\u201d they said on Secret Chats. \u201cIt made me so insecure. Long story short, I tested positive for gonorrhea and chlamydia.\u201d Another Flo user said that it was \u201cheartbreaking\u201d to get a positive STI result but that once they started treatment, it was all over quickly. \u201cIf your discharge is green, run to the doctor!\u201d they said. \u201cI went in for pelvic pain and STI symptoms and found out I had gonorrhea, chlamydia,trichomoniasis, andpelvic inflammatory disease (PID).\u201d At first, they found the diagnosis \u201chumiliating.\u201d Thanks to the stigma surrounding STIs, many people feel ashamed when they find out that they have one, even though they are nothing to be embarrassed about. STIs are not onlyvery common; they are alltreatable. As the Flo user explain went on to explain: \u201cIt was humiliating, heartbreaking, and terrifying. But luckily, it all cleared up in two weeks after treatment. The reality is STIs are so treatable and can be cured so fast. Just get tested!\u201d Does gonorrhea make you bleed? Another symptom of gonorrhea is abnormal vaginal bleeding, which typically happensin between your periodsor after sex. You should always get any bleeding like this checked out by your doctor. Does gonorrhea make you sick? As we\u2019ve seen, gonorrhea symptoms (if there are any) are often mild, but the infection can cause moreserious health complicationsif it\u2019s left untreated. That\u2019s why getting tested as soon as possible is important if you have any worries or suspicions. The most common issues include: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) If a gonorrhea infection spreads to the uterus, uterine tubes, or ovaries, it becomes a condition calledpelvic inflammatory disease (PID). It can take anything from justa few days to a few weeksfor gonorrhea to develop into PID. The most common symptom of PID ispain in your lower belly, but it can cause other symptoms, including: Chills or a fever Irregular periods Nausea and vomiting Abnormal discharge that\u2019s usually yellow or green with an unusual odor Painful sex Pain when peeing When it\u2019scaught early, PID will usually clear up quickly with antibiotics. However, untreated PID canpermanently damageyour reproductive organs and, in some cases, lead to infertility. In fact, tubal factor infertility (primarily caused by PID) accounts for approximately30% of casesof infertility. PID can also increase the risk ofectopic pregnancy, which is when a fertilized egg implants in your uterine tubes rather than the uterus. This can understandably sound terrifying, but it\u2019s worth emphasizing that not all women with PID develop infertility. Only around10% to 20% of untreated gonorrhea caseswill turn into PID, and just8% of those with PIDwill experience infertility caused by damage to their uterine tubes. So, while it\u2019s important to be fully aware of the potential long-term consequences of gonorrhea and PID, once you\u2019re on the case with testing and treatment, you\u2019ll most likely be able to clear any infection before serious issues have a chance to develop. Pregnancy complications Untreated gonorrhea can beharmful to your babyif you have the infection when you\u2019re pregnant. It has been linked to miscarriage, premature birth, low birth weight, and complications around labor. Your baby can alsocatch the infectionas they pass through the birth canal. This can be very worrying to hear if you\u2019re expecting but know that because of these risks, your doctor will screen you for gonorrhea at your veryfirst prenatal health visit. That means they should be able to catch and treat a gonorrhea infection before it causes any issues. Can gonorrhea affect your period? It might seem like gonorrhea can affect your period, as it can causebleeding between periods and after sex. But this bleeding is caused by thecervix getting infectedrather than the uterus lining shedding (aka your period). Less commonly, gonorrhea can makeperiods heavier. But there\u2019s currently no evidence suggesting that gonorrhea can impact how regular your period is. Can you get tested for gonorrhea while on your period? Yes,you can\u2014 so don\u2019t let your period hold you back from getting tested ASAP. Thetests for gonorrheaare sensitive enough that being on your period won\u2019t usually impact the result. But Dr. Twogood says, \u201cIt may not be as accurate depending on how heavy the blood flow is,\u201d so chat with your doctor about the best time to take a test. You can always repeat it later if you want extra reassurance. You can also take a urine test, so try not to worry. How do you get gonorrhea? So, now that you know about the possible signs of gonorrhea, what can you do to avoid it? Well, any sexually active person can catch the infection, which is caused by a bacteria that\u2019s spread through the genitals viavaginal fluid or semen. This can happen duringvaginal, anal, and oral sexor through sharing sex toys with an infected person. The best way toprotect yourselffrom catching gonorrhea is to always usecondoms. When it comes to oral sex, using adental dam(a thin piece of plastic that creates a barrier between the mouth and penis or vulva) can alsooffer protection. But it\u2019s important to know that condoms can\u2019t offercomplete protectionagainst gonorrhea and othertypes of STIs. These infections are easily transmissible, and the only way to eliminate yourchances of getting an STIis toavoid all vaginal, anal, and oral sex. Understandably, this isn\u2019t a realistic option for most people, which is why it\u2019s important not to beat yourself up if you do end up catching an STI one day. After all, these infections are incredibly common, withone in five peoplein the United States having an STI at any given time. Getting the right treatment as soon as you can is the best way to protect yourself from any long-term consequences. How long can you have gonorrhea without knowing? \u201cYou can have gonorrhea for a long time without knowing!\u201d says Dr. Twogood. \u201cSometimes, gonorrhea infections never become symptomatic. This is why it\u2019s important to be screened, to stop symptoms from developing, and prevent spreading to other people.\u201d If you think you might have gonorrhea, whether it\u2019s because you\u2019ve spotted symptoms or have slept with someone who could have it, you should get tested as soon as you can. Some people are atgreater riskof catching gonorrhea and should get tested regularly whether they\u2019re worried they\u2019ve got it or not. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that sexually active women should gettested every yearif: You are under 25 years old You are older than 25 but have multiple sex partners If you haven\u2019t had anSTI testbefore, they\u2019re pretty straightforward andshouldn\u2019t hurt. The screening for gonorrhea will involve either aurine or swab testand can happen through your regularhealth care provider, at a public health clinic, or by taking an at-home test. Does gonorrhea go away? There\u2019s no way around it: You need toget treatmentif you catch gonorrhea. \u201cIt is an infection and will not go away on its own,\u201d says Dr. Twogood. \u201cUntreated gonorrhea can take several paths. It can be and remain asymptomatic (no symptoms), it can cause progressive and persistent symptoms of abnormal vaginal discharge or vaginal irritation and inflammation, or it can progress to PID.\u201d Gonorrhea is usually treated with anantibioticinjection in your bottom, thigh, or one of your veins. To avoid passing it to anyone else, it\u2019s important not to have sex (even with a condom) untilseven days after finishing treatment. Your partneror partners will need to get tested for gonorrhea too if you have it. Telling someone they might have an STI can be really difficult, but it\u2019s so important for yoursexual healthand theirs. It can help to be open andtalk about STIswith them from the start so the subject feels less taboo. We\u2019ve got more tips onhow to have that conversation. And always keep in mind that STIs like gonorrhea are very common:Half the US populationwill get an STI at some point during their lifetime. What you\u2019re going through is more normal than it probably feels like right now and is definitely nothing to be ashamed of."

But you\u2019re not alone: Chlamydia is a verycommon sexually transmitted infection (STI), especially among young people. In fact, in the United States, it\u2019s themost commonly reportedSTI of all. Also known as chlamydia trachomatis, the infection is caused by atype of bacteriathat\u2019s spread during vaginal, oral, oranal sex. So, how do you know if you\u2019ve got it for sure? Get the lowdown on what chlamydia can feel like and how to get it figured out with a bit of help from a Flo expert. Plus, hear about real-life experiences from ourSecret Chatscommunity (a safe space in our app where members chat anonymously about all things health). Key takeaways Most of the time, chlamydiadoesn\u2019t cause any symptoms. Women that do get symptoms can experience things likeunusual vaginal discharge,painful sex, and abnormalvaginal bleeding. If it\u2019s left untreated, chlamydia can lead tomore serious health complicationslike infertility \u2014 but the infection is easily cured with acourse of antibiotics. Usingcondomscanreduce the riskof catching or spreading chlamydia. What does chlamydia feel like? Usually, chlamydiadoesn\u2019t feel like anythingat all. In fact, it\u2019s sometimes called asilent infection, with 50% to 70% of people never experiencing any symptoms. But what about those that do get symptoms? \u201cFor women with symptoms, they may experience abnormal vaginal discharge, irritation, or odor,\u201d says Flo expertDr. Renita White, obstetrician and gynecologist, Georgia Obstetrics and Gynecology, US. \u201cMen with symptoms may experience pain with urination or discharge from the penis.\u201d Let\u2019s look at the possible chlamydia symptoms in women in more detail. Symptoms of chlamydia The following can be signs of chlamydia and are worth getting checked out by your doctor: Discharge from the vaginathat\u2019s white, yellow, or gray and may have a strong smell Pain when you peeor the need to pee more frequently (chlamydia is often mistaken for a urinary tract infection) Pus from your urethrain your pee Painful sex Painful periods Abnormal vaginal bleeding, which might happenbetween periodsorafter sex Bleeding, discharge, or pain from your bottom Itching or burningin and around your vagina Dull painin your lower belly But what can it feel like to have chlamydia? Sharing their story on Secret Chats, one Flo member said they just didn\u2019t \u201cfeel right.\u201d They explained: \u201cI had period cramps all the time, plus lower back pain and bloating. I just didn\u2019t feel right, and sure enough, I had chlamydia.\u201d People\u2019s experiences of chlamydia symptoms can vary (if they get symptoms at all). For example, another Flo user said they noticed \u201cyellow, chunky discharge and itching down there (meaning in and around their vulva.\u201d Finding out you\u2019ve got chlamydia can bring up difficult emotions, too. One Flo member told the Secret Chats community they felt \u201cdisgusted\u201d with themselves when they first got it, but over time, they realized they hadn\u2019t done anything wrong. \u201cIt\u2019s like catching a cold,\u201d they said. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re getting treatment, that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d It\u2019s normal to feel guilty or embarrassed about catching an STI like chlamydia, but that doesn\u2019t mean you deserve to feel that way. \u201cI also felt ashamed when I tested positive for an STI,\u201d said another Flo user. \u201cBut talking to all my fellow 20-something friends, it\u2019s incredibly common. It\u2019s just that no one talks about it. I\u2019d say most 25-year-olds have had an STI before. Try to remind yourself it\u2019s not something to be ashamed about \u2014 it happens.\u201d Complications of chlamydia Even if you don\u2019t get any chlamydia symptoms, the infection can lead toserious health complicationsif it\u2019s left untreated. These include: Pregnancy complications If you\u2019re pregnant with a chlamydia infection, it can lead topreterm (or early) deliveryand be passed to your baby, making them more prone to illnesses like pneumonia or conjunctivitis once they\u2019re born. All this can sound really scary if you\u2019re pregnant, but it\u2019s reassuring to know your health care provider will test you for chlamydia early on at yourfirst prenatal appointment. This means that even if you do have the infection, there should be enough time to treat it before it causes any problems for you and your baby. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) If the bacteria from chlamydia spreads from your vagina or cervix to yourreproductive organs, which include youruterus, uterine tubes, and ovaries, it becomes PID. Some of the common symptoms includepain around the pelvisor lower belly,painful sex, pain when peeing, and unusual or heavy discharge \u2014 although some women don\u2019t get any obvious symptoms. If PID is left untreated, it canpermanently damagethe reproductive organs and lead to infertility. It can also increase your chances of having anectopic pregnancy, which is when a fertilized egg implants in one of your uterine tubes rather than the uterus. If you want to have a baby one day, discovering your fertility could be at risk can understandably be very upsetting. But while untreated chlamydia can lead to PID and fertility complications, it\u2019s not a given \u201410% to 15% of womenwith chlamydia will develop PID, but not all of them will go on to have fertility issues. Take what happened to this Flo member, for example. \u201cI gotchlamydia when I was 21,\u201d they said on Secret Chats. \u201cMy signs were a strange discomfort in my abdomen, spotting between my period, and just having an instinct that I had it. I gave myself anxiety for 12 years because I thought that chlamydia had crushed my dreams of becoming pregnant. \u201cNow I\u2019m 32 years old and currently pregnant! It happened without me even trying, and I am ecstatic!! Whoever has or has had chlamydia, don\u2019t worry or stress. Get yourself treated and take care of yourself mentally afterward.\u201d How long can you have chlamydia without knowing? There\u2019s no limit to how long you can have chlamydia without knowing, given it usuallydoesn\u2019t cause any symptoms. \u201cIt is possible to have had chlamydia and never know,\u201d says Dr. White. \u201cTherefore, it is best to get regular STI testing to know your status, whether you have symptoms or not.\u201d Does chlamydia make you bleed? As we learned earlier, chlamydiacan make you bleedfrom your vagina or from your bottom. The vaginal bleeding is often aslight as spotting, typically happening between periods or after sex. \u201cWhile one of the potential symptoms of chlamydia is irregular vaginal bleeding, chlamydia treatment does not cause bleeding,\u201d says Dr. White. So if you\u2019re experiencing any light to heavy bleeding after chlamydia treatment, you should get in touch with your health care provider as this needs to be checked out. Can chlamydia affect your period? So if it causes bleeding, does chlamydia also delay your period? \u201cChlamydia doesn\u2019t affect your period, as chlamydia-related bleeding is from the cervix,\u201d says Dr. White. \u201cBut because bleeding between periods from the cervix can be a symptom, it may seem to you that your menstrual cycle is being affected.\u201d If you\u2019re unsure about your menstrual patterns and when your next period is due,tracking your cyclein an app like Flo can help you learn more about your body. Can you get chlamydia from having sex on your period? \u201cYou can get chlamydia anytime you have unprotected sex with someone who is infected with chlamydia,\u201d says Dr. White. \u201cThis can happen whether you are on your period or not.\u201d You may be wondering ifperiod sexmakes you more susceptible to infection, but this is not necessarily the case, according to Dr. White. \u201cInfections that are passed through blood (like HIV and hepatitis) may have a higher chance of being transmitted during period sex,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, chlamydia is transmitted through bodily fluids in general. So it can be passed during regular sex or period sex.\u201d Can I take chlamydia medication on my period? You sure can. There\u2019s no suggestion that it is unsafe to take eitherdoxycyclineorazithromycin\u2014 themost common medicationsused to treat chlamydia \u2014 while you\u2019re menstruating. How to get rid of chlamydia It can be really upsetting to find out you\u2019ve got any STI, but chlamydia can be easily treatedwith antibiotics. As mentioned above, themost common typesprescribed for this STI are doxycycline (100 mg twice a day for seven days) or azithromycin (one dose of 1g). You may be wondering what a confirmed chlamydia infection means for your sex life. Well, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends abstaining from sexfor seven daysfrom the start of your chlamydia treatment to avoid passing it on to others. You should alsotell any recent sex partnersabout your diagnosis so they can get tested. We\u2019ve gottips on how to have that conversation. As one Flo member put it on Secret Chats: \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to have those serious talks with your partner(s). It\u2019s tough, but it needs to happen. Those serious talks beforehand can help you avoid something like chlamydia or something more extreme. And bottom line, get regular checkups.\u201d It\u2019s worth flagging that it\u2019s common for women to getreinfected with chlamydiaif their partner hasn\u2019t been treated too or if they have sex with their partner during the seven days after either one of them starts treatment. Whether you believe they\u2019ve had their own treatment or not, the CDC recommendsretesting for chlamydiathree months after your initial treatment. There are more measures you can take toreduce the riskof getting STIs like chlamydia again in the future, including usingcondomsand only having sex within a monogamous relationship. However, as neither of these precautions can completely eliminate the risk, it\u2019s still essential to continue regularSTI testingto check for any infections."

        "content": "Doesmy vaginasmell normal? It\u2019s one of those questions we\u2019ve probably all thought about at some point. And as the \u201cfeminine hygiene\u201d industry might want you to believe thatyour vulvashould smell like cotton candy or a strawberry sundae, this may leave you feeling a little self-conscious. That\u2019s understandable. But the thing is,healthy vaginasaresupposedto smell like a part of the human body. And they can all smell slightly different from person to person. It\u2019s natural if yours has a mild smell. Still, it\u2019s nice to have some reassurance, especially given how little the topic is discussed. Plus, an unusual odor (think strong or fishy) might be a sign that something\u2019s amiss.Read on to find out exactly what vaginal odor is and when to see a doctor. Key takeaways It\u2019s completelynormal and healthyfor your vagina to have a smell. It might smell slightly differently at different points in your menstrual cycle and can be a good signifier of what\u2019s going on in your vagina and vulva. Amazing, right? It\u2019s typical for your vagina tohave a mild scent, but if the smell isoverpowering, fishy, or unpleasant, it could be a sign of an infection or a bacterial imbalance. A strong,fishy vaginal odorcould be a sign of a condition calledbacterial vaginosis (BV)or asexually transmitted infection (STI).BVandmost infectionsare treatable, so don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to your health care provider. Vaginal smell: Is it normal? Before we get into the details of vaginal odors, a quick note: You\u2019ll readvagina and vulvaused throughout this piece and may wonder if they\u2019re the same thing. Often these two terms are used interchangeably, but this isn\u2019t accurate. The part of your genitalsthat you can see on the outside is your vulva. Your vagina is inside your body. It\u2019sa muscular tubethat attaches your vulvato your cervix.Check out thisarticle on anatomywith diagrams for more information.When we talk about \u201cvaginal smells,\u201d we mean scents coming from your vulval region. Remember that it\u2019scompletelynormal for a healthy vaginato have a mild smell.The exact smell will depend on what you naturally smell like, where you are in your menstrual cycle, and other factors, like whether you\u2019ve had sex lately or have been working out.Yours may smell: Slightly sour or tangy Slightly sweet Slightly metallic \u2014 like copper \u2014 when you\u2019re on your period (This is because your blood has iron in it.) The smell of your vagina is often related to itspH balance and how acidic it is. You might not have thought about pH levels since chemistry class, but they influence the health of your vagina. Here\u2019s how: There are lots ofdifferent \u201cgood\u201d bacteriathat live in your vagina. They make up what\u2019s known as your vaginal flora. Bacteria is often seen as a negative thing, but your vaginal flora plays a crucial role in protecting you against infection. Amazingly,your vagina is self-cleaning, and your vaginal flora plays a key part in keeping yours healthy. It also keeps your vagina at the right pH level \u2014 around3.8 to 4.2. This means a healthy vagina is naturally slightly acidic.Theacidity of your vaginahelps keep levels of yeast and bacteria in balance. It\u2019s this that causes the mild smell. Do all vaginas smell different? We\u2019re all different \u2014 andso are our vaginas. The way your vagina smells is pretty unique to you, andit can change throughout your cycleand in response to sex, exercise, and major lifestyle changes. Here\u2019s why: Your vagina maysmell slightly metallic during your period. This is because your period blood contains iron. And because your hormones fluctuate during pregnancy, expecting a baby can impact your vagina\u2019s pH levels too, causing new smells. You might notice a slight change in the way your vulva smells after you\u2019ve worked out. This is because there area lot of sweat glands in your groin. Anything that affects your generalbody odor, like an intense workout orstress, can also affect the smell around your vulva.\u201cThis odor is different from vaginal odor, but can mimic vaginal odor due to the proximity to the vagina,\u201d explainsDr. Renita White, an obstetrician and gynecologist from Georgia, US, who sits on Flo\u2019s medical board. Similarly, the smell of your vagina maychange in response to sex, assemen has a different pHfrom your vagina. What could abnormal or unpleasant vaginal odor indicate? Since everyone\u2019s vaginas can smell slightly different, it\u2019s handy to get used to what\u2019s normal for you. A mild scent can indicate that everything is normal, but anoverpowering or unpleasant vaginal smellcan indicate a condition that needs attention. This may sound scary, but as Dr. Whiteexplains,\u201cThough a new foul odor may indicate a problem, it is usually treated, and it is very common for this to happen. There is no reason to be embarrassed or ashamed.\u201d These are the most common reasons for an unpleasant vaginal odor: Bacterial vaginosis Vaginal discharge with astrong, fishy smellcan be a sign ofbacterial vaginosis (BV). You may notice this fishy smell, particularly after having sex.BV can also cause irritation, aburning sensation when you pee, and a thin, whitish-gray discharge. It\u2019s caused by a change in thenatural balance of bacteriain your vagina. This can happen if you wash using heavily scented soap. BV isn\u2019t asexually transmitted infection (STI), but having sex without a condom can increase your risk of getting BV. Book an appointment with your doctor if you think you might have symptoms. It\u2019s easily treated withantibiotics. Sexually transmitted infections A fishy smell from your vagina can also be asign of an STI, including gonorrhea, chlamydia, or trichomoniasis. You might have also noticed achange in the way your discharge looks. If your discharge appears yellowish or green, is lumpy, or has a very strong smell, then call your health care provider for an STI checkup. This might sound daunting, but STI tests are very quick and mostly painless. Your doctor will then be able to prescribe the right course of treatment. If left unchecked, STIs can get worse, and your symptoms may become more severe as time goes on. You may develop other conditions, such aspelvic inflammatory disease, or you could developcomplications if you try to get pregnantin the future. So, it\u2019s really important that you see your health care provider if you notice any of the symptoms associated with an STI. Urinary tract infection If your urine is smellier than usual (remember, urine does smell), it could be a sign of aurinary tract infection(UTI). UTIs don\u2019t always cause symptoms, butspeak to your health care providerif your urine has a strong smell and looks cloudy, you experience a strong urge to pee that doesn\u2019t go away after using the bathroom, it burns when you pee, and/or you have abdominal pain.Most UTIs are easily treated with antibiotics. Pelvic inflammatory disease Another reason you might notice a change in the way your vagina smells is due to an infection known aspelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID isn\u2019t an STI, but it can developif an STI is left untreatedand spreads to your uterus, ovaries, and uterine tubes. This can lead to long-term problems like infertility. While PID doesn\u2019t always havesymptoms, it can also causebleeding between periods, unusual discharge, and pain during sex, so be sure to get any of these symptoms checked out by your doctor. If you\u2019ve left a tampon in for too long When your period arrives, it can be really easy to pop a tampon in and go about the rest of your day. So easy that time can get away from you \u2014 and suddenly it\u2019s been in for longer than the recommendedeight hours. Generally speaking, this isn\u2019t too much to worry about. However, it can start to smell. If you use tampons, you\u2019ve likely heard horror stories abouttoxic shock syndrome(TSS). TSS is caused bybacteria that produce toxins. As your vagina is a warm and moist environment, it\u2019s really easy for this bacteria to grow. It can happen if you leave a tampon in for too long. TSS can causenausea and vomiting, a fever, and muscle aches and can be life threatening. This may sound scary, but TSS is incredibly rare. Only around1 to 3 people in every 100,000will experience it. That said, it\u2019s very important to get medical help immediately if you have any symptoms. How to clean your vagina and vulva So what can you do to keep your vaginal smell in balance? While it\u2019s normal for your vagina to have a mild smell, there are some things you can do to feel fresh. Remember, incredibly,vaginas are self-cleaning, which means you don\u2019t have to do a lot to maintain its balance. In fact, strong soaps and detergents can cause more harm than good. And there are some hints and tips you can follow to take care of your vulva: Use water on its own or a mild soap. Your vulva is a sensitive area, and using harsh, perfumed soaps can lead to irritation.Plain, unperfumed soap or just water is best. They may smell good, but perfumed products can change your vagina\u2019s pH levels and could cause an infection. For similar reasons, you don\u2019t need to douche or spray water into your vagina. Wearingloose-fitting, cotton underwear. Cotton is breathable and soft, so it won\u2019t rub against or irritate the skin around your vulva. Change out of sweaty workout gear as soon as possible. Sweat around your groin can change the way your vulva smells. When you\u2019re on your period,change your pad or tamponevery four to eight hours to avoid the buildup of bacteria. When you go to the bathroom,always wipe from front to back. When to see your doctor and what to say Whatever your vagina smells like, there is no need to be embarrassed or ashamed. Get to know your vagina and what\u2019s normal for you at different times in your menstrual cycle. Abouta third of the time, abnormal vaginal odor goes away without treatment, as your vagina is self-cleaning and thebody regulates its own bacteria. However, if you\u2019ve noticed a new and unpleasant smell, and you\u2019re not sure what\u2019s caused it, seek advice from your doctor. They may ask you tocome in for an appointmentso they can examine you, talk through any other symptoms you might be having, and figure out what might have triggered the smell."

        "url": "https://flo.health/menstrual-cycle/lifestyle/fitness-and-exercise/exercising-during-period",
        "publication_date": "Updated03 February 2023|",
        "content": "Exercise can help promote a healthy lifestyle for most people. This can be especially important when it comes to hormonal balance. Some exercises and techniques can be beneficial during your period, and others should be avoided during this time. The following article provides information about the dos and don\u2019ts of exercising during your period. Benefits of exercising during your period Exercise is often the last thing anyone wants to do when they\u2019re on their period, and there are variousmyths about exercise in general. But doing some light exercise on your period has been proven to alleviate many symptoms such as: Pain Cramps Bloating Depression Mood swings Irritability Fatigue Nausea These are just a few of the benefits you could experience while exercising during your period. In addition, general physical fitness is important for health and can reduce the risk of serious medical issues such as heart attack, stroke, arthritis, osteoporosis, and diabetes. Exercise doesn\u2019t need to be strenuous nor happen every day to help. A recent study found that exercise can help with at least 30 chronic diseases. There are physical and chemical changes that occur in the body during menstruation that can be alleviated through exercise. In fact, exercise can increase the production of endorphins (\u201cfeel-good hormones\u201d) and reduce anxiety, depression, and pain, improving your mood. Best exercises to do on your period Most people would suggest that during your period, it\u2019s better to do the exercises you can tolerate, that are good for your body, and that you like to do. For many people, the first day or two of their period may be not the best time to exercise. This is typically due to a heavier flow. During this time, you may feel more comfortable exercising at home. If the first few days of your periods are difficult, take it easy and make modifications to your workouts as needed. So, what are the best exercises to do on your period? Here are a few suggestions: Walking:This is an easy exercise that doesn\u2019t require any special equipment, clothing, or location. You can take as much time as you have or need, and you can adjust your speed however you want. Light cardio or aerobic exercise:This is not meant to be a stressful workout. The key word here is \u201clight.\u201d Whether you\u2019re jogging, cycling, swimming, or anything else, take it easy and/or consider a shorter workout than normal. Strength training:If you\u2019re up for it, try some gentle strength exercises and consider lighter weights than you might normally use. Avoid heavy-duty lifting at this time in your cycle. Gentle stretching and balancing:Yoga is great for relaxing the muscles and decreasing cramps and pain. Pilates is good for stretching muscles and reducing cramps and pain. Tai chi is good for reducing tension and stress. Exercising while on your period: Things to avoid Exercising during your period shouldn\u2019t put additional stress on the body, cause pain, or interfere with the normal process of your cycle. Exercise during your period can be beneficial, but there are certain things to avoid, including the following: Strenuous or prolonged exercisemight not be good for the body when you are menstruating. This doesn\u2019t mean you have to stop your normal training, but be cautious. One study found that 60 minutes of moderate to intense exercise during menstruation caused exercise-induced inflammation. If you feel unusually fatigued, nauseous, or there is an increase in pain or discomfort,stop what you are doing and rest. If these symptoms continue, stop completely. Ignore the saying \u201cno pain, no gain.\u201d Listen to your body. Period hygiene when exercising Hygiene during your period is important, including while you\u2019re exercising. Here are a few basic rules. First, choose period products that you\u2019re comfortable with. If you\u2019re concerned about leaks while exercising during your period, then you might choose to use a tampon. However, if you don\u2019t normally use tampons, this is not the time to try them out. They can be distracting or painful if not inserted correctly. Other period products, like pads, menstrual cups, and discs, work just as well or even better than tampons for some people. You can also combine some of these products to keep your underwear from getting stained. Use whatever works best for you. It is a good idea to carry period products with you when you exercise just in case your period starts earlier than expected.This can be caused by hormonal fluctuations. After exercising: Take a shower. Change your underwear. Use a fresh pad or tampon. Change into fresh clothing if your workout clothes are sweaty or stained. Remember, even if you are close to the end of your period, the increased movement, different positions, or stretching duringexercise may cause some spotting. This is normal and can usually be managed with panty liners or period products. However, if you experience spotting between periods for unexplained reasons, it is best to consult your health care provider."

        "content": "Foods to eat during your period If yourperiod calculatorpredicts your next next bleed is just around the corner and you want to be prepped to stave off the usual premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms you experience, tweaking your diet could be one way to tackle it. When the PMS hits, try one of these healthy options to help ease your symptoms: If yourperiod calculatorpredicts your next next bleed is just around the corner and you want to be prepped to stave off the usual premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms you experience, tweaking your diet could be one way to tackle it. When the PMS hits, try one of these healthy options to help ease your symptoms: Salmon Rich in omega-3 fatty acids, this fish is known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which relax the uterus and fight cramps. Consider making a meal of grilled salmon or salmon sushi for a dose of high-quality protein and plenty of B vitamins. Dark chocolate You probably don\u2019t need another excuse to eat some chocolate. It\u2019s undoubtedly one of the most popular foods to eat during your period for numerous reasons. Loaded with antioxidants and magnesium, dark chocolate is a great comfort food. Try to stick to plain dark chocolate as opposed to complex candy full of additives and other ingredients. These will only deliver empty calories with little to no health benefits.However, it's still important to consume chocolate in moderation since even dark chocolate contains sugar and caffeine. Oatmeal Oats are a whole grain rich in calcium and vitamins A and B, and they\u2019re also a great source of iron. One cup contains about 14 of your daily recommended 18 milligrams of iron. One study found that a higher intake of the type of iron found in oatmeal was associated with a lower risk of PMS symptoms. Oatmeal is also a great option if you have an upset stomach. Watermelons, figs, and plums The natural sugars found in these foods may satisfy cravings for something sweet. Additionally, these fruits are rich in vitamins that can help with bloating. Watermelon also has a high water content and can help keep your body hydrated, which will reduce swelling and bloating. Citrus A smart alternative to sugary treats, oranges, lemons, and limes are packed with fiber and vitamin C and can provide relief frommood swingsandbloating. Meanwhile, their high water content also keeps you hydrated. CombatPMS-related nauseaand fatigue with a glass of lemon water or a (lightly sweetened or unsweetened) citrus smoothie. Moderation is key for getting a dose of feel-good energy without irritating your stomach. Eggs The iron, fat-soluble nutrients, B vitamins, essential fatty acids, and protein in egg yolks do wonders for PMS. But if you have a sensitive stomach, avoid hard-boiled eggs, which can cause gas, bloating, and heartburn. Chamomile Last on the list of foods to eat while on your period: chamomile tea. This soothing beverage can help relax your nerves and your uterus. It reduces the severity of cramps, squashes stress and anxiety, and even promotes better sleep. Foods to avoid during your period During menstruation, you\u2019re simultaneously losing blood and undergoing rapid hormonal shifts. Opt for foods with ample nutrients like vitamins, minerals, water, protein, iron, and fiber. At the same time, try your best to avoid the following: Processed foods Canned foods, heavily processed meat, and other items made with chemicals and preservatives can make bloating and water retention worse. High levels of sodium are unhealthy at any time of the month, but they do even more damage during your period. Candy and snacks Satisfy your sweet tooth by choosing juicy fruit, and try to avoid sweet snacks. They contribute to bloating and gas, while delivering a short-term spike in blood sugar. A brief sugar high inevitably leads to a major crash, leaving you feeling worse than before. Alcohol When you\u2019re on your period, reduce or eliminate consumption of alcoholic beverages. Why is this important? The loss of blood at this time lowers your blood pressure, making you more vulnerable toalcohol\u2019s side effects. It also aggravates fatigue and boosts menstrual flow. Spicy foods Already struggling with tiredness,intense bleeding, and cramps? Then eating spicy dishes may add gas and bloating to your list of ailments. If you can\u2019t bring yourself to give up spicy food, you might be better off opting for healthy options like fresh chilis. Furthermore, some studies suggest that cinnamon, turmeric, and fennel could help battle common PMS symptoms, but more research is required to determine if this is true. These spices and herbs may contain anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and anti-hypertensive properties. Just practice portion control to prevent an upset stomach. Always talk to your health care provider before taking any herbs or supplements for your symptoms. FAQs: Which foods to eat during your period Why am I craving chocolate? Eating chocolate releases endorphins and serotonin, which regulate your mood and balance neuromediators, encouraging relaxation. After getting used to this positive reaction to chocolate, your body starts to crave it. It intensifies during your period because of hormonal shifts and the loss of blood and nutrients. Consider swapping that chocolate bar with a serving of sliced fruit. If that doesn\u2019t seem realistic, then opt for dark chocolate with less sugar when you really want to indulge. How does eating citrus affect your period? As mentioned, water with a twist of lemon increases your vitamin C intake and helps you stay hydrated. Fresh-squeezed juices and blended smoothies are awesome foods to eat on your period as long as you minimize the sugar content. Fruit contains plenty of natural sugars, so there\u2019s no need to add more. What happens if you eat spicy foods? Each person is unique, and some claim that spicy foods actually fight period pain. On the other hand, those with a sensitive digestive system report feeling nauseous and bloated after consuming spicy foods. Scientists have yet to confirm or deny either of these claims. Takeaway There is an abundance of delicious foods to eat while on your period to get you through the monthly pain and discomfort. To aid digestion and regain what\u2019s being lost during menstruation, avoid sugary, salty, and fatty treats and pick heart-friendly, high-fiber meals with tons of fruits and vegetables instead. When preparing vegetables, cooking them at a low to medium temperature will preserve as many nutrients as possible. Avoid deep-frying them or using too much butter or oil; instead grill, roast, or steam them to maximize benefits. Lastly, don\u2019tskip mealswhile on your period as this tends to aggravate nausea and fatigue. Choose natural, unprocessed products when possible, anddrink plenty of waterto stay hydrated and manage your PMS symptoms effectively."

        "content": "Benefits of breast massage Massaging the breasts has the same benefits as massaging other parts of the body, such as relaxation. There are some extra benefits from breast massage, including: Improved lactation experience Cancer detection Lymphatic flush Muscle tension relief Although breast massagers exist, they\u2019re not necessary: hands will do just fine. By the way, if you were wondering how to make breasts bigger by massage \u2014 it\u2019s simply not possible. Improved lactation experience Lactating can benefit greatly from breast massage. Breast massage therapy can ease the breasts\u2019 sensitivity and provide better blood circulation to the breast. Gentle massage can alsoincrease milk supply. Massage can help warm up and loosen the tissues around the breasts\u2019 milk ducts and help the milk flow. Nipple massage is also beneficial to breastfeeding people who have flat nipples, as it can help the nipples protrude and make it easier for the baby to latch on. Breastfeeding mothers can massage their breasts any time of the day or night, but if you want toimprove milk production, it\u2019s advised to massage the breasts about 15\u201330 minutes before it\u2019s feeding time. This helps tokeep milk productionclose to the baby\u2019s schedule. Cancer detection Breast self-examination can help detect lumps early in their development, which can lead toearly detection of cancer. Some lumps are noncancerous and go away on their own. Others are cancerous and need to be tested as early as possible. Breast cancer is best fought in the early stages, so early detection is key. Regular breast massage, can familiarize you with what your breasts feel like. This way you can more quickly tell when something\u2019s abnormal. Lymphatic flush There are hundreds of lymph nodes located all over our bodies. These nodes are small, bean-shaped structures that are part of the body\u2019s immune system. These little beans filter substances that are located in lymphatic fluid. The lymph system in our bodies is not connected to the heart \u2014 or any pumping organ for that matter \u2014 so the fluid does not move throughout the body on its own. It\u2019s propelled by muscle motion only. Movement or activity is necessary for the lymph system to flow properly. Stretches, light activity, and breast massage therapy are all great ways to help flush your lymph system. The area between your lower breast and your armpit can get quite sore when there\u2019s stagnant lymph fluid. This may happen during your menstrual cycle as well. Massaging your breasts can help flush the lymph fluid from your chest and ease any pain from swollen lymph nodes in that area. Muscle tension Massage is an ideal relief for tight and sore muscles. There are pectoral muscles underneath the breasts, and those muscles can get tight and sore after heavy lifting, exercise, or illness. Massaging the breasts can help relieve tension held in the pectoral muscles. Our chest muscles work together with the back muscles to keep our posture straight and our bodies upright. A back massage may not feel complete without a chest massage, and you may still feel tension in your body. How to massage breasts Now that you know why massaging your breasts can be beneficial, you\u2019re probably wondering how to massage breasts. Generally, there\u2019s no right or wrong way to massage the breast. Just like the rest of the body, apply gentle pressure \u2014 circular motions and smooth strokes are both great ways to massage. But there are a few different techniques for breast massage, depending on why you are massaging. If you\u2019re massaging for lactation, then follow this method: Start with one breast and place four fingers on the top and four on the bottom. Massage gently in a circular pattern. Move to the sides of the breast and repeat the massage. If you\u2019re interested in breast massage for lactation, it\u2019s best to ask a lactation consultant for advice and proper technique. If you\u2019ve been treated for cancer and you\u2019re massaging your breasts to check for lumps, it\u2019s important to be careful. Radiation therapy and surgery leave tissue in a fragile state. A licensed massage therapist who is trained in breast massages and cancer therapy can provide the support your breasts need during the massage. Be sure to ask a doctor if you need breast massage. Contraindications to breast massage If you have recently recovered from breast cancer or are undergoing breast cancer therapy, it\u2019s medically advised to treat your breasts very gently. If you want a massage, hire a licensed massage therapist who is trained for breast cancer therapies. Conclusion Breast massage has many benefits: it can alleviate tension, reduce swelling, and help you feel more connected to your body. Set up a massage routine so you can check your breasts for abnormalities, increase lactation, or flush your lymph system regularly."

        "title": "Can menopause cause a burning sensation in your body?",
        "url": "https://flo.health/menstrual-cycle/menopause/symptoms/menopause-burning-sensation",
        "publication_date": " 16 July 2024",
        "content": "Have you noticed an unusual burning sensation lately, but you\u2019re not sure what could be causing it? Perhaps it burns when you pee, or your vagina feels curiously hot all of a sudden. Maybe your mouth is on fire, or your hands and feet feel tingly. Menopause might be the last thing that springs to mind. But if you\u2019re somewhere between your late30s and your 50sand your menstrual cycle has started to change, it could suggest that menopause is on the way. This is especially likely if you\u2019ve noticed other telltale symptoms such asmood swingsorbrain fog. Experiencing any type of burning sensation can be uncomfortable and maybe even a little alarming if you don\u2019t know what\u2019s causing it. But once you figure out the cause, with the right treatment, it can be manageable. If it turns out to be a signal you\u2019re in the lead-up to menopause (known asperimenopause), remember that there are lots of treatment options depending on your symptoms, so reach out to your doctor for advice. Perimenopause aside, a burning feeling under the skin may becaused by any number of things, from an insect bite toshingles. Feelingburning in the vulva or vaginamight suggest you\u2019ve got an infection, so the best thing to do in any case is to see your health care provider, who can help you find the cause. If you are on the journey to menopause, read on asDr. Allison K. Rodgers, reproductive endocrinologist, obstetrician, and gynecologist from Illinois, US, shares everything you need to know. From why a burning sensation can happen at this stage of life to how to deal with it, find out all about one of the lesser-known perimenopause symptoms. Key takeaways Some women and people with periods notice burning sensations in their vagina, their mouth, or their skin, hands, or feet around the time of menopause. Fallinglevels of the hormone estrogen\u2014which is what happens during the run-up to menopause \u2014are thought to be the main cause of burning, tingling, and unusual skin sensations, says Dr. Rodgers. Hormone therapy (HT, previously calledhormone replacement therapyor HRT) may be offered to help treat the most common menopausal symptoms. While research is limited to say whether HT could ease burning sensations linked to perimenopause or menopause, it may helpsome people. Can menopause cause a burning sensation in my body? You\u2019re probably familiar with the term menopause, but the symptoms linked to it can start earlier than you think, during what\u2019s called perimenopause. The termsperimenopause and menopauseare often used interchangeably, but they\u2019re two separate things. Perimenopauseis the phase leading up to menopause (the official name for your final period), plus one year after. Perimenopause usually begins somewherebetween your late 30s and 50s\u2014 but most often in your 40s. Then, when you haven\u2019t had a period for 12 months (this happens most commonlybetween the ages of 45 and 55), you\u2019re classed as having gone through menopause. From that point on, you are postmenopausal. Menopauseis a process that everyone who\u2019s born with a female reproductive system will go through. Perimenopause can often signal the start of new symptoms such ashot flashes, sleepless nights, and more. These differ for everyone \u2014 some people might not notice many symptoms at all, while others might feel them more intensely. A burning sensation in one or more areas of your body is a possible sign of perimenopause. \u201cMost symptoms of menopausal-related burning are in the vagina, vulva, and bladder/urethra,\u201d says Dr. Rodgers. But other people \u201cmay noticedryness of their skinand mouth and [more] rarely will have numbness, tingling, or burning in their hands and feet,\u201d she adds. Experts aren\u2019t completely sure why some women experience a burning sensation in the run-up to menopause, so more research is needed. But just like other, more widely known perimenopause symptoms such asbrain fog,headaches, andhot flashes, it\u2019s believed to be caused by changing hormones. Estrogenis a hormone that plays an important role in lots of your body\u2019s functions. To make this happen, you haveestrogen receptors in different parts of the body. When estrogen levels go up and down during perimenopause before eventually reducing for good, this can affect you in lots of different ways due to all those estrogen receptors. One thing that can happen is thatyour vaginal liningor your skin may becomedehydrated and less elastic, which can trigger unusual sensations such as a burning feeling in yourvagina,mouth, or yourhands and feet. Vaginal burning You may already be aware of one thing that can happen during perimenopause:vaginal dryness. This is a symptom of a medical condition calledvaginal atrophy\u2014 when your vaginal walls start to become thinner and dryer \u2014 and it can cause a feeling like burning or itching. \u201cPeople can feel a dry, tight, painful burning sensation in their vagina,caused by the drop in estrogen,\u201dexplains Dr. Rodgers.Having less estrogen can also make yourvaginal canal narrower, which may add to your discomfort. \u201cThis is caused by reduced blood flow to the vagina and the loss of vaginal folds,\u201d Dr. Rodgers adds. Vaginal burning can be uncomfortable and may make your day-to-day andyour sex life difficult. But your doctor may be able to help, so schedule an appointment with them. Burning mouth syndrome If you experience scalding, tingling, or even a bitter and metallic taste on your tongue, you may haveburning mouth syndrome, which is a lesser-known condition that peaks during perimenopause. \u201cDry mouth can be a really irritating perimenopausal symptom,\u201d says Dr. Rodgers. And similar to vaginal burning, thecause is also likely hormone related. \u201cSince estrogen also keeps the mucosal membranes [the moist lining] in our mouths healthy, the drop in estrogen during menopause can cause dryness of this as well,\u201d she adds. If your dry or burning mouth starts happening regularly enough to bother you, make an appointment with your doctor. It may betriggered by something else, like acid reflux, an allergy, or certain medicines. But if they find that perimenopause is the cause, and you\u2019ve also got other symptoms (like hot flashes), hormone therapy may be suggested. You might find it helps with a burning mouth, but keep in mind that it\u2019s not guaranteed to work in this way, asone studypoints out. Tingling hands and feet A perimenopause symptom that\u2019s rarely talked about is tingling in your hands, feet, or elsewhere \u2014 also known asparesthesia. If you notice an unusual sensation anywhere in your body that feels a bit like pins and needles, or if your arms and legs start tingling or become numb and itchy, there\u2019s a chance perimenopause could be the cause. Of course, it\u2019s still important to get checked by the doctor to rule out any other cause. One studysuggests that just over 30% of perimenopausal women may notice paresthesia, although more research is needed. \u201cThis symptom of [peri]menopause is not well understood,\u201d says Dr. Rodgers. Just like other common symptoms during the menopause transition, these tingling sensations are thought tohappen because low estrogen levels\u201ccause changes to the peripheral nerves,\u201d she explains. In some cases, tingling in the hands and feet canhappen as a result of low vitamin B12 levels. Any type of nerve sensation can be unsettling, but there may be things you can do to ease any discomfort. Your doctor will be able to share some advice that\u2019s relevant to you. Hot flashes If you notice a burning sensation that feels like heat creeping through your chest, neck, and face, and you are perimenopausal, then it is most likely ahot flash. This common perimenopause symptom affectsmore than 80% of women. And if you gethot flashes at night, they\u2019recallednight sweats. Also known as \u201cvasomotor symptoms,\u201d hot flashes can be uncomfortable and may keep you up at night. In this case, \u201ctemperature regulation can help,\u201d Dr. Rodgers says, so dress in layers that can easily be removed if a hot flash comes on, invest in a fan to help youkeep cool, and try to limitalcohol. If none of this helps, speak to your doctor, as treatment options are available. Dry or itchy skin Estrogenis closely linked to skin hydration, so lower levels of the hormone can cause your skin to become less elastic and dehydrated. This can make you feel dry and sometimes itchy. A drop in estrogen also means less collagen is produced, which can leave the skin feeling less supple. Lower collagen can also sometimesresult in a tingling sensation or the feeling of something crawlingon the skin (known asformications), although this is more common in postmenopausal people. How can I relieve menopause-related burning sensations? If you\u2019re finding your perimenopause symptoms tricky to handle, chatting with people in a similar situation may make you feel less alone. You can do exactly that inFlo\u2019s safe community space, Secret Chats. Download ourcycle-tracking appto get involved in these conversations, as well as keep a log of your cycles, note your symptoms, and more. Like any new and persistent symptom, the best thing to do is always get it checked by a doctor so they can try to find the cause. If it turns out to be menopause related, there are a few different treatment options they might suggest, but these can differ depending on what kind of burning sensation you\u2019re experiencing. You can read on to find out more about the specific treatment options for vaginal burning, burning mouth syndrome, tingling hands and feet, hot flashes, and dry or itchy skin. But one thing that may be suggested for all perimenopausal symptoms is to make some lifestyle changes. Doing your best to lead a healthy lifestyle is always a good idea around the time of menopause, regardless of your specific symptoms. Your doctor may suggest youaim to reduce stress, exercise regularly, and improve your diet if possible.Foodsthat are low in fat and high in fiber, like whole grains and lentils, as well as fruits and leafy green vegetables, are ideal. These contain essential vitamins and minerals and will hopefully help to make you feel good. Dr. Rodgers adds that \u201ccutting out caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, and cannabis\u201d may also help. Treatment for vaginal burning \u201cUsing a vaginal lubricant or a vaginal moisturizer can be helpful,\u201d says Dr. Rodgers. Beyond that,atreatment that can be offered ishormone therapy. HT increases low estrogen levels and \u201creverses many of the menopausal changes that cause symptoms of vaginal burning,\u201d explains Dr. Rodgers. HT is typicallygiven bypills, vaginal rings, inserts, or skin patches. There are two other hormonal treatment options that can help tackle vaginal burning. One is vaginal estrogen therapy, which is more localized than HT because it\u2019s only used in the vagina rather than the whole body. This can either be applied asa cream or inserted as a suppository or a ring inside your vagina. The other is calledintravaginal dehydroepiandrosterone(more commonly known as DHEA), which works bymaking the vaginal wall thicker and more moist. Both of these changes could help to ease the feeling of burning. Treatment for burning mouth syndrome There area few thingsyour health care provider might suggest trying if you\u2019ve got a burning mouth. Certain medications, such as ones to block nerve pain, others used for seizures, or antidepressants, may help. Prescribed mouth rinses may also be an option, and \u201cstaying hydrated [and] sucking on ice, mints, or gum can often help this feeling,\u201d says Dr. Rodgers. If the problem is ongoing, you may want to consider trying something different.Researchsuggests that a type of talking therapy known as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) could help those with burning mouth syndrome symptoms, so this could be something to explore. Hormone therapy is unlikely to be prescribed for burning mouth syndrome alone. But if you have other perimenopause symptoms, your doctor may suggest it, and you may find it helps relieve your burning mouth at the same time. Aswith many things,there are pros and cons of hormone therapy. It\u2019s right for some people and less so for others. Chat with your doctor about it, and they can help you decide whether it\u2019s the right option for you. Treatment for tingling hands or feet The best thing to do is ask your doctor about how best to tackle your paresthesia. Some peoplesee an improvement in symptoms with exercise, so try to make time for some movement if you\u2019re able to. If it\u2019s being caused in part bylow vitamin B12, speak to your doctor about what they would advise. You could also try upping your levels withfoods that are naturally rich in the vitamin, such as meat, fish, milk, cheese, and cereals. While hormone therapy isn\u2019t usually offered for paresthesia, if you have other perimenopause symptoms like hot flashes, your doctor may suggest you try it. There\u2019s a chance that increasing your estrogen levels in this waymay help to reduce tingling sensationsat the same time. Cognitive behavioral therapy may also be something to explore. Although you might not imagine talktherapycould be useful for a physical sensation, it has beenshown to helpsome people. Treatment for hot flashes While hormone therapy is often thego-to treatment for certain perimenopause symptoms like hot flashes, it might not be something you can \u2014or want \u2014 to use.If you\u2019re already usingcombined hormonal contraceptive pills, then your doctor might suggest youkeep taking themin the early stages of perimenopause. They may help ease hot flashes as well as regulate unpredictable cycles\u2014another common symptom of perimenopause. Contraceptive pills work bysteadying your changing hormone levels, which means they can be helpful during perimenopause. \u201cThere are some nonhormonal options to help with symptoms as well,\u201d says Dr. Rodgers. Someselective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which are otherwise typically taken to help mood disorders, may be one option. Others include a seizure medication calledgabapentin, a hay fever medication calledfezolinetant, and an overactive bladder medication calledoxybutynin. As with any type of medicine, they may come with side effects, so it\u2019s important to discuss your options with a doctor so you know what to expect. Treatment for dry or itchy skin When your estrogen levels drop during perimenopause, it can make you lessthirsty, meaning you drink less and risk becoming dehydrated\u2014which can affect your skin. Further research is needed to understandthe link between hydration and dry skin conditions, but drinking plenty of water is always a good idea to improve your health. Don\u2019t forget that you can consume more fluids by both eating and drinking. Aim to take in the recommended daily amount \u2014 which is about11.5 cups or 2.7 liters\u2014 even if you don\u2019t feel thirsty. You can alsokeep your skin in good health generally during perimenopauseand beyond by eating a balanced diet and avoiding smoking. For crawling sensations on your skin, there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all approach to stopping them, but you might notice that these start to ease if you take treatments (like HT, for example) for other perimenopause symptoms."

Like these, changes to your cycle during the run-up to menopause can generally be due to your hormone levels changing. \u201cYour periods get closer together or further apart due to the fact that the ovaries are starting to wax and wane in their function,\u201d explains Dr. Jones. This means the amount of hormones being produced by the ovaries also becomes quite unpredictable, which is what messes with your bleeding patterns. It can be hard to keep track of irregular periods and other symptoms when you\u2019re going through perimenopause, and that\u2019s where acycle-tracking applike Flo can help. In the app, you can log symptoms like brain fog andvaginal drynessalongside tracking your periods.Premium subscriberseven get a cycle report each month to help you understand your body better. What else causes irregular periods? Your periods might end up alittle inconsistentfor reasons other than perimenopause, so it\u2019s always worth getting checked out by your health care provider to make sure you know what\u2019s behind it. You may assume you\u2019ve had two periods in one month, for example, but the extra bleeding may instead have been caused by a health issue, including: Polyps:Uterine polypsare small growths found inside your uterus that can cause bleeding. They\u2019re not usually serious, butyour doctorwill always want to confirm the cause of any irregular bleeding, so make sure to book an appointment to get checked out. Fibroids:Uterine fibroidsare growths in your uterus that can cause changes to your bleeding patterns. Not all fibroids will require treatment, but your doctor will be able to advise you on the best option for you if you have them. Infections:Somesexually transmitted infections (STIs)can causevaginal bleedingas a symptom. If you\u2019ve had unprotected sex recently and are worried you may have an STI, go andget a test. If it does turn out to be an STI, there\u2019s nothing to be embarrassed about \u2014 health care providers will have seen plenty of other cases like yours before. Endometrial hyperplasia:Thickening of youruterine liningcan occur at perimenopause, leading to abnormal periods. Adenomyosis:This is a condition where thelining of the uterus begins growing into its muscular wall, and it can cause heavy bleeding outside of your regular cycle. Cancer:Somecancers, such as cervical cancer, have symptomsthat include bleeding between periods or after menopause, but rest assured, this is rare. Whatever the cause of your irregular bleeding \u2014 whether it\u2019s perimenopause, one of the medical conditions listed above, or anything else \u2014 your doctor will want to get to the bottom of it. So make sure you book an appointment just to be on the safe side. What to expect from your period during perimenopause If your periods become closer together or hard to predict, it can be frustrating. It\u2019s nice to be able to plan around your cycle, after all. There\u2019s no fail-safe way to know how your periods might behave at this time, says Dr. Jones, butFlo\u2019sclever technology may be able to help you detect some patterns in your cycle and be better prepared. Plus, it\u2019s worth remembering that perimenopause is an important life stage that all women and people with periods go through, and there are plenty of treatment options available if you\u2019re finding the symptoms tricky to manage. As you progress through perimenopause, you might experience any number of the following changes to your menstrual cycle: \u200b\u200bHeavier periods:Your flow may become heavier over time, explains Dr. Jones, \u201cThe period may be heavier as the uterine lining has had an opportunity to build up over months,\u201d she says. If bleeding is unusually heavy (for example, if you\u2019rerepeatedly soaking through your pad or tampon within an hour), always be sure to consult your doctor. Lighter periods:On the other end of the scale, a lot of women experience reduced blood flow orspottingfor up to a year before their periods stop completely. \u201cIncomplete shedding of the lining can lead to spotting in between periods or lighter periods,\u201d adds Dr. Jones. Skipped periods:Your ovaries may not releasean egg(ovulate)every cycle during perimenopause, leading to a missed period. This is often normal. Keep in mind, though, that you\u2019re still fertile. So, if you\u2019re having unprotected sex and you\u2019ve missed your period, consider taking a pregnancy test. Longer or shorter periods:If your period previously lasted for four days, but now it\u2019s two or six days, for example, this is normal. You might even experience a random combination of both shorter and longer cycles andperiods during perimenopause. Again, it\u2019s all due to the up-and-down hormone levels. Other symptoms of perimenopause Everyone\u2019s experience of perimenopause is different. Some people find itdifficult to managetricky symptoms, such as heavy or irregular periods, while others don\u2019t. Symptoms vary, but most people experience at least one of the following at some point during perimenopause: Irregular or missed periods or periods that are heavier or lighter than usual Hot flashesthat feel like sudden, uncomfortablewaves of heatand may come withheart palpitations and dizziness Problems falling or staying asleep, often as a result of hot flashes Vaginal drynessand discomfort during sex Reduced sex drive Brain fogthat might feel like alack of focus, poor memory, and difficulty concentrating Mood swings, includinglow mood, irritability, tearfulness, andreduced energy levels Joint painorstiffness Remember, there are plenty of treatment options for all sorts of perimenopause symptoms \u2014 you can read up on them below. Schedule an appointment with your doctor to start discussing which route is best for you. How to treat perimenopausal symptoms If perimenopausal symptoms are causing disruption to your life, don\u2019t assume you just have to put up with them. In fact, there are a number of treatment options available to help you feel like yourself again. Some of the main types of perimenopause treatment include: Hormone therapy:Taking the hormone estrogen can be aneffective treatmentfor many perimenopause symptoms, including hot flashes,night sweats, andirregular periods. As with many health treatments,there are pros and cons of hormone therapy. Chat with your doctor about it, and they can help you decide whether it\u2019s a good option for you. Vaginal estrogen:This is a type of hormone therapy that isused internallyto help relieve vaginal dryness, some urinary symptoms, and pain with sex. Antidepressants:Some medications usually given for mood disorders have also been found to reduce perimenopause symptoms likehot flashesand night sweats. This could be an option if you don\u2019t want to take HT or if you\u2019ve been advised that you shouldn\u2019t for medical reasons. Hormonal contraceptives:Using the combinedbirth control pill for perimenopausemay help tolevel out your changing hormone levelsand could reduce symptoms in the early stages of your transition toward menopause. Vaginal moisturizer:Just like the skin on your face, if your vagina feels dry, then regularly applying moisturizer can help to keep it supple, providingrelief from vaginal dryness. Vaginal lubes:Some people find sex painful thanks to vaginal dryness and less naturallubrication. Applying a pea-sized blob of lube before you get started and during sex can bea great way to stop the discomfort. Lifestyle changes:For many people, simplelifestyle changescan help with perimenopause symptoms. \u201cLeading a healthy lifestyle [can help] across the board,\u201d says Dr. Jones. She recommends doing things like \u201cmaking healthy dietary choices, staying active, getting enough rest, and having outlets to deal with stress.\u201d Are you unsure which foods to include in your diet? Try \u201cadding more protein, fiber, fruits, vegetables, and calcium-rich foods,\u201d she says. Limiting your alcohol and caffeine intake can also help, as \u201cboth can exacerbate hot flashes and interfere with getting a good night\u2019s rest.\u201d Strength training:Now would also be a good time to focus on strength training tobuild muscle, explains Dr. Jones. \u201cDecreasing estrogen levels causes a loss in muscle mass,\u201d she says. \u201cMuscle building will help you positively impact your bones, which are also affected by declining estrogen levels.\u201d Cognitive behavioral therapy:Thistalk therapy (also known as CBT)has beenshown to be effectivein mood-related and sleep-related perimenopause symptoms, as well as hot flashes. Chat with your doctor for more advice on whether to explore this option. Treatment options differ according to the symptoms you\u2019re experiencing and how severe they are, so reach out to your doctor to discuss your options. They will likely ask you questions about your menstrual cycle, including the length and type of bleeding you experience, so having a record of it onan app like Flocan be useful. When to see a doctor If your periods are becoming inconsistent or different, make an appointment with your doctor. \u201cAny change in your bleeding should prompt a visit to your obstetrician and gynecologist (OB-GYN), as perimenopause isn\u2019t the only thing that can cause irregular bleeding/spotting,\u201d advises Dr. Jones. Especially prioritize being seen by a doctor if you\u2019ve got \u201cbleeding that is interfering with your quality of life, specifically, causing you to miss work, or [stopping] you from doing things you enjoy such as hanging out with friends, exercising, etc.\u201d she adds. If you experience any of the following accompanying symptoms, your health care provider will definitely want to examine you to rule out other causes: Heavy periods:Very heavy periods \u2014 which Dr. Jones describes as \u201cbleeding through a pad [or tampon] per hour for more than two hours\u201d \u2014 accompanied byblood clots larger than the size of a bottle capshould be looked into. Fatigue:If you\u2019re struggling with low energy levels, see your doctor: \u201cBleeding that causes anemia or results in signs such as tiredness or fatigue [may be] concerning,\u201d says Dr. Jones. Spotting:Bleeding between periods or after sex isn\u2019t always a cause for concern, but it\u2019s a good idea to get it checked out just in case. Periods closer together:While changes to your period are normal, it\u2019s still worth being seen by a doctor if you gettwo periods in one monthor any other variations. \u201cBleeding that lasts longer than seven days or periods less than 21 days apart are all reasons to see your OB-GYN,\u201d says Dr. Jones."

        "content": "Does a little bit of pee come out when you laugh, cough, or run for the bathroom? We all experience the occasional urine leak every now and then. But if it happens regularly, you may find it embarrassing or feel like it\u2019s interfering with work, your self-esteem, or your relationships. If you can\u2019t get to the toilet in time and it\u2019s starting to impact your life, you might have a bladder control problem \u2014 akaurinary incontinence (UI). Incontinence can happenat any time, and it getsmore common as we age. So try not to feel any shame. A number of factors could be the cause of your leakage, including taking certain medicines, drinking alcohol or caffeine, or having aurinary tract infection (UTI). We also know pregnancy and childbirth can have a huge impact on bladder control. However, if you\u2019re somewhere between your late30s and your 50s, your periods have started to become inconsistent, and you struggle to hold in your pee for any length of time, bladder weakness could be because ofperimenopause\u2014 a sign that menopause is on the way. Menopause is a normal life transition that most women go through, but everyone experiences it differently. For some, symptoms such ashot flashes,brain fog, and incontinence can feel difficult to live with, while others may not spot any signs at all. The good news is that if you\u2019re finding things tricky, with the right treatment, urinary incontinence is manageable, and you don\u2019t have to continue living with it. Here,Dr. Sameena Rahman, clinical assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology, Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine, Illinois, US, shares everything you need to know about urinary incontinence in perimenopause, including symptoms, causes, and best treatment options. Key takeaways Up to 40%of middle-aged women (which is around the time perimenopause happens) experience loss of bladder control, and over 50% report incontinence problems postmenopause. Dropping estrogen levelscombined with weakenedpelvic floor musclescontribute to incontinence during perimenopause. Treatment options are available to help with bladder leakage, including lifestyle tweaks, procedures, and medications. Your doctor will be able to help you come up with a plan to tackle it. Kegel exercisescan also do a lot to help strengthen your pelvic floor muscles andimprove bladder control. Chat with your doctor so they can share everything you need to know before you get started. Why can\u2019t I hold my pee all of a sudden? If you\u2019ve been struggling to hold in your pee, as well as noticing other telltalesigns of perimenopause, such ashot flashes,night sweats, andmood swings, your loss of bladder control could be menopause related. Urinary incontinence is \u201cthe involuntary loss or leakage of urine or loss of control of your bladder,\u201d says Dr. Rahman. It can alsomake you need to pee more often than normal. It can affect anyone, but \u2014 thanks to falling hormone levels \u2014 it\u2019s acommon symptomduring perimenopause and even more common aftermenopause. Before we get started, it\u2019s worth explaining that perimenopause and menopause often get mixed up, but they\u2019re actually two separate things. Perimenopause describes the years leading up to menopause (which is the name given to your final period) being confirmed. This stage usually begins somewherebetween your late 30s and 50sbut most often in your 40s. You\u2019re then diagnosed as having gone through menopause when you haven\u2019t had a period for 12 months (thisusually happens between the ages of 45 and 55). From then on, you are postmenopausal. During perimenopause, your hormone levels go up and down before eventually dropping off. As well as regulating your menstrual cycle,estrogenplays an important role in keeping your bladder and urinary tract in check. \u201cThe muscles, ligaments, urethra, and vagina have receptors for [estrogen],\u201d explains Dr. Rahman. When estrogen levels drop, this can cause the lining of yoururethra(the tube where your pee comes out)to thin. Around the same time, your pelvic floor muscles \u2014 which support many of yourlower organs, including your bladder and vagina\u2014 often start to relax with age,making you more prone toincontinence. Many women also experience a dip incollagenandelastin productionat this stage of life, which are both important for strength and structure inside your vagina. Thiscan make your vagina less elastic, which leaves your urethra weaker and means you may be more likely to leak urine. Thetwo most common typesof urinary incontinence that affect women during perimenopause include: Stress urinary incontinence:This involves leaking urine \u201cwith physical exertion such as jumping, running, or sports activities, or when sneezing, laughing or coughing,\u201d says Dr. Rahman. If you\u2019ve ever leaked a little pee while bouncing on a trampoline, this is what you\u2019re experiencing. Urge urinary incontinence:If you notice an \u201curgency or sudden desire to urinate that you cannot overcome,\u201d this is urge incontinence, adds Dr. Rahman. It's one of the symptoms of anoveractive bladder. Some people can also experience mixed urinary incontinence, which is both stress and urge incontinenceat the same time. Urinary incontinence affects 30% to 40% of middle-aged women andover 50%postmenopause. If you frequently leak urine or struggle to get to the bathroom in time, a shift in your hormones might be to blame. Speak to your doctor for advice. Treatment options are available, and you don\u2019t have to continue living with it. How to spot the signs of urinary incontinence Are you often desperate to pee or struggling with accidental leaks? It\u2019s a good idea to get checked out by your doctor if you noticeany of the following: You leak urine during everyday activities, such as lifting, coughing, or exercising You feel unable to hold in your pee after a sudden, strong urge to urinate You suddenly pee without any warning or urge You are regularly unable to reach the toilet in time You wet the bed during sleep You leak during sexual activity It\u2019s even more important to speak to your health care provider if you experience any of the following: You can\u2019t pass urine or empty your bladder, which can be a sign ofurinary retention You start peeing eight or more times a day You spot blood in your urine \u2014 known ashematuria You have bladder infection symptoms, including pain when you pee They\u2019ll be able to help you figure out what\u2019s going on and direct you to a specialist if necessary. How to manage perimenopause and menopause incontinence If you\u2019re struggling with leakage \u2014 and you suspect perimenopause might be to blame \u2014 know that there are a number of treatment options available to help you feel like yourself again. Remember, too, that you\u2019re not alone in perimenopause. Flo\u2019s safe community space, Secret Chats, allows you to anonymously share how you\u2019re feeling and read through other people\u2019s experiences of perimenopause symptoms.Download the appnow to get involved in conversations like these, as well askeep track of your cycles and symptoms. In some cases, a few simple lifestyle changes can make a big difference to incontinence. Chat with your doctor about the following treatment options: Strengthening your pelvic floor Taking care of yourpelvic floorshould be a priority at any age. This important group of muscles and ligaments that stretch from your pubic bone to your tailbone plays a crucial role in supporting your bladder, vagina, uterus, and bowel. Aside from controlling when you poop, pee, or pass gas, maintaining pelvic floor strength cansupport vaginal delivery during childbirth, and it plays a crucial role in sex, too.The truth is that your entire pelvic floor canweaken with age, which, in turn, can make you less able to control your bladder. That\u2019s why doctors often recommend doingpelvic floor exercises, like Kegels, tostrengthen the area. Regular little squeezes, as if you were trying to hold your pee midflow, is all it takes \u2014 and you can do them just about anywhere. To do your Kegel exercises,try the following: Find the right muscles:Yourpelvic floor musclesare activated when you try to stop your flow of pee midstream, explains Dr.Rahman. Once you\u2019ve figured out which muscles to contract, you can do Kegels anywhere at any time. Perfect your technique:The best way to do Kegels is toimagine you\u2019re sitting on a marble. Tighten your pelvic muscles as if you\u2019re lifting the marble. Try it for three seconds at a time, then relax for a count of three. Aim for three sets of 10 to 15 repetitions a day. If you need help:For extra guidance, seek out a pelvic floor physical therapist \u2014 like a personal trainer for your pelvic floor. Cutting down on alcohol and caffeine There\u2019s nothing wrong with enjoying a glass of wine every now and then or having a morning coffee to get the day started. But if you sometimes take your alcohol or caffeine (or both!) indulgence to excess, and you\u2019re struggling with having less bladder control \u2014 now might be a good time torethink this aspect of your lifestyle. \u201cLimit consumption of alcohol, caffeine, and [fizzy] drinks,\u201d advises Dr. Rahman, adding that these \u201ccan contribute to increased pressure on your bladder and irritate the lining.\u201d In turn, this can make you need to go to the bathroom more often. Maintaining a healthy weight Maintaining ahealthy weightis a good idea for lots of reasons, and it can have its benefits for bladder issues, too. While weight gain due to menopause iscommon, if it gets intoexcessive weight gain, over time, this may strain and weaken your pelvic floor muscles, which can lead to less control for your bladder. Try to aim for a healthy weight for you and your body type. A balanced diet that\u2019s rich in whole grains, fruits, seeds, nuts, eggs, leafy green vegetables, legumes, lean proteins, and sources of healthy fat, like olive oil and avocados, is a good place to start. Reach out to your doctor for help if you feel like you could use some specific advice. Giving bladder training a go You might not have heard ofbladder training techniques, but Dr. Rahman says they can really help with urinary incontinence. And there\u2019s no class to attend because you can teach yourself.Bladder training is a type ofbehavioral treatment. The idea is that you retrain your brain and bladder by following a fixed schedule that includes \u201clearning to control your stream and reducing the frequency of bathroom visits.\u201d Using what doctors call \u201curge suppression techniques\u201d to control your bladder can help if you feel an urge to pee before it\u2019s time to go to the bathroom. This kind of self-training can take time and practice, so ask your doctor for advice if you\u2019re thinking of trying it. Switching up your workouts Ifstress incontinenceis the culprit for you, then low-impact exercise might be the way to go. Dr. Rahman says moves like jumping \u201cmay damage [your] pelvic floor more.\u201d So you could try swimming, cycling, or yoga instead. But there are workarounds if you don\u2019t want to forgo that high-intensity interval training class. \u201cSometimes, something simple like using incontinence underwear can safely get you through a workout or a run,\u201d she adds. Chatting with your doctor about treatment options If your reduced bladder control is impacting your daily routine or quality of life, then it\u2019s time to get help. Remember that your doctor is on hand to support and advise you during perimenopause, so don\u2019t put off booking an appointment.They might suggest a couple of different treatment options, depending on your symptoms, the type of incontinence you have, your medical history, and personal preference, such as: Medications (such asMirabegron) that help to relax the muscle in the bladder by preventing it from contracting. It\u2019s these contractions \u201cthat can lead to urgency, frequency, and loss of urine.\u201d Hormone therapy(previously known ashormone replacement therapyor HRT) isn\u2019t generally given directly for incontinence in the same way it might be suggested for other perimenopause symptoms such as hot flashes and brain fog. However, vaginal estrogen therapy (which can come either asa cream, suppository that goes in your vagina, or a ring) can be very helpful if your urge incontinence is part of a wider condition calledgenitourinary syndrome of menopause or GSM. You may have GSM if you have:Genital symptoms (dryness, irritation, and burning of the vagina and vulva)Sexual symptoms (being less naturally lubricated and feeling pain during sex)Urinary symptoms (being desperate to go to the bathroom all the time, getting UTIs, and experiencing bladder leakage) Genital symptoms (dryness, irritation, and burning of the vagina and vulva) Sexual symptoms (being less naturally lubricated and feeling pain during sex) Urinary symptoms (being desperate to go to the bathroom all the time, getting UTIs, and experiencing bladder leakage) If this sounds familiar, chat with your doctor, and they can help you decide whether it\u2019s a good option for you. Medications that contain vaginal estrogen or DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone, a hormone that helps trigger estrogen production). According to Dr. Rahman, these can \u201crestore vaginal flora [healthy vaginal bacteria] and improve blood flow and the production of collagen to enhance the normal function of muscles, [the] urethra, and [the] vagina.\u201d Procedures, such as Botox in the bladder for urge incontinence or urethral bulking injections (which is like a filler for the urethra) for stress incontinence. In more advanced cases,surgerymay be considered. This may sound daunting, but if your doctor thinks this option could benefit you, they will clearly explain what it involves, and you can decide if it\u2019s the right path to take. Other treatment options, including \u201cpessaries [devices inserted into your vagina] placed to help with the pelvic floor,\u201d have been foundto help with stress urinary incontinence. Reading up on biofeedback therapy Biofeedbacktherapy is a type of mind\u2013body technique. It teaches you to take control of certain involuntary bodily functions, such as your heart rate, breathing, and \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 muscle movements that cause you to pee. The good news is it\u2019s been found to improve pelvic floor strength and decrease urinary incontinence for some people. Dr. Rahman explains how it works: \u201cA pelvic floor therapist [gives] you feedback on how you are contracting and relaxing your muscles and how the tone of your pelvic floor muscles is responding to your exercises.\u201d You can also buy a pelvic floor training device to use at home to help strengthen your pelvic floor. They\u2019re usually made of silicone and slip inside like a tampon, and some models provide biofeedback advice via an app. Ask your doctor for more information if you think this could be an option to explore for you. Caring for your well-being during perimenopause and after menopause Everybody experiences perimenopause differently. As we\u2019ve seen, certain lifestyle changes may be worth a try to ease certain troubling symptoms caused by perimenopause or menopause. For some people, such symptoms can be difficult to live with andmay affect mental well-being, especially when combined with other factors like a high-pressure job, parenting, or caring for aging relatives. If you\u2019re finding this to be a difficult time, support from like-minded people can really help. Open up to a doctor, family, and friends, or even the community onFlo\u2019sanonymous Secret Chats space for support."

Spottingisblood or bloody vaginal dischargethat isn\u2019t heavy enough to require a pad or tampon. It can be quite common \u2014around a third of womenwill experience what\u2019s known as abnormal uterine bleeding in their lifetime, which can include spotting. And it can happenfor a number of reasons, such asimplantation bleedinginearly pregnancy,polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or asexually transmitted infection (STI). But if you\u2019re aged somewhere between your late30s and your 50s, there could be another possible reason for spotting: You may be approaching menopause, also known asperimenopause. Spotting is one of thesigns of perimenopausethat can show up alongside other more common symptoms likehot flashesandbrain fog.Read on to learn more about spotting during perimenopause, and remember to always reach out to your health care provider if you\u2019re at all worried. Key takeaways It\u2019s normal for yourperiods during perimenopauseto become unpredictable, which means you might experience spotting. Spottingis typically quite light \u2014not enough to require a pad or a tampon, for example. Perimenopausalchanges to your hormonesaside, there can be lots of other reasons why you might experience spotting \u2014 includingbirth control side effectsorfibroidsymptoms. Your doctor can help you figure out the cause, so book a checkup if you\u2019ve noticed any changes to your cycle. What does perimenopause spotting look like? Spotting can be a sign of perimenopause, but you might not be completely clear on what perimenopause actually is. The termsmenopause and perimenopauseare often thought of as the same thing when, in fact, they\u2019re two separate things. Perimenopause describes the years leading up to menopause (your final period). It usually begins anywherebetween your late 30s and 50sbut most commonly happensin your 40s. You\u2019re classed as having gone through menopause when you haven\u2019t had a period for 12 months (this isusually between the ages of 45 and 55). From then on, you are postmenopausal. Everyone is unique when it comes to perimenopause, which means no two people have the exact same symptoms, but changes to your period at this time of life are pretty common. \u201cSpotting is bleeding noted outside of a woman\u2019s normal period,\u201d explainsobstetrician and gynecologist Dr. Angela Jones, New Jersey, US, adding that you\u2019ll most commonly notice it \u201cwith wiping, after sex, or on other occasions.\u201d Your cycle can be harder to predict during perimenopause because your periods can become irregular as they start to wind down. But spotting isn\u2019t the same as when you get your period. The bleeding is usually lighter, so you don\u2019t generally need to reach for a pad or a tampon. Color wise, spotting is typically light or dark brown or a pink tinge to your discharge. If you\u2019re not sure what\u2019s what, usea cycle-tracking app like Floto jot down your symptoms and bleeds, and you may start to see some patterns. If you\u2019re at all worried about changes to your cycle, then reach out to your doctor for a checkup. What causes spotting during perimenopause? Just like other more widely known perimenopause symptoms such asbrain fogandhot flashes, spotting can happenbecause of changing hormone levels. When you have regular periods, your levels of the hormones estrogen and progesterone rise and fall in a continuous cycle every month. This helps your body to prepare for a potential pregnancy, but once you hitperimenopause, your hormone production begins to change. In particular, the levels of estrogen produced by your ovariesstart tovary more than before, fluctuating between high and low levels. This up-and-down estrogen production can lead to unpredictable bleeding patterns. \u201cThe cycle may be longer or shorter, and periods can be lighter or heavier,\u201d says Dr. Jones. \u201cThere can be bleeding or spotting in between periods.\u201d If you\u2019ve already taken steps to manage your perimenopause symptoms with hormone therapy (previously known as hormone replacement therapy or HRT) or you\u2019re onbirth control for perimenopause, it\u2019s worth noting thatthese methods can resultin abreakthrough bleed. This is similar to spotting, and it usually settles down within a few months. When is spotting a concern? If you experiencebleeding between periods, don\u2019t shrug it off. Although it\u2019s likely nothing to worry about, spotting could also be a sign of an underlying condition. \u201cAny spotting that interferes with a woman\u2019s quality of life or that persists is a concern,\u201d says Dr. Jones. \u201cSpotting also becomes concerning depending on a woman\u2019s risk factor profile: specifically, obesity,Pap smear history[for example, ifanything abnormalhas previously been picked up during a cervical screening], and if there is a risk of an underlying infection.\u201d You should also visit your doctor or obstetrician and gynecologist if you experience any of the following: Persistent or increasing spotting Bleeding after sex Spotting that\u2019s accompanied by dizziness, fever, abnormal vaginal discharge, or abdominal/pelvic pain Postmenopausal bleeding Using acycle-tracking app like Floto track your periods can help you spot changes in your cycle. You can log symptoms like spotting in the app, and you\u2019ll then get a report each cycle showing when they happened, which you can easily share with your doctor. Other causes of abnormal bleeding Bleeding between periodscan be caused by reasons other than perimenopause. These are some of the most common: Hormonal imbalance:Changes to your hormones caused by things like obesity,PCOS, and thyroid problems can lead to bleeding between periods. Pregnancy:Complications during pregnancy can be a cause of spotting, says Dr. Jones. \u201cThis is important as some forget that you can still become pregnant during this stage in life [perimenopause].\u201d Uterine Polyps:These tiny growths are sometimes found in the uterus and can cause spotting. They don\u2019t oftencause many other symptoms, and they\u2019re noncancerous, so try not to worry if you find out you have them. Only in very rare cases, if they\u2019re left untreated, do they go on to become more serious. Uterine fibroids:Similarly, thesegrowthsthat form in the uterus can also lead to bleeding between periods. Most small fibroidsdon\u2019t need any treatment, although larger ones may mean you need medication or, less commonly, surgery. Infection:An infection of your reproductive organs caused by an STI orpelvic inflammatory diseasecan cause spotting. These are generally treated with a course of antibiotics. Birth control:Some light bleeding is a common side effect of takingthe pillor using ahormonal intrauterine device(more commonly known asan IUD). It shouldn\u2019t hurt or last for long, though. Cancer:Much less commonly, certain types of cancer of theuterusandcervixcan lead to spotting. If you\u2019re not sure what\u2019s causing your spotting, book an appointment with your health care provider. They\u2019ll be able to provide advice, put together a personalized treatment plan if needed, and direct you to the right specialist should you need one. If it is perimenopause related, they can also help you manage any other symptoms you might be experiencing too. Can you do anything about spotting? Unpredictable periods can be stressful and annoying for some people. Menopause (and perimenopause in the lead-up to it) is a process that all women and people with periods go through, but if unexpected bleeding is starting to interfere with your life, don\u2019t feel like you have to live with it. Treatment for spotting varies depending on the cause, so reach out to your doctor to discuss your options. They will likely ask you questions about your menstrual cycle, including the length and type of bleeding you experience, so having a record of it on an app like Flo can be useful. If your doctor finds that perimenopause is responsible for your spotting, they may recommend a couple of different options.Some birth control pillshave also been foundto act like hormone therapy, so they can be used by some people as a two-in-one \u2014 bothbirth control and relief from perimenopause symptoms. If you\u2019re experiencing other perimenopause symptoms (like hot flashes orvaginal dryness) as well as spotting, then hormonal therapy might be an option. \u201cHormonal options can be used to treat spotting as well as to temper any other symptoms that can be associated with perimenopause,\u201d says Dr. Jones. Chat with your doctor for advice, and they\u2019ll help you weigh your options."

        "content": "Key takeaways The first timeyou have sex, it might feel awkward, nerve-racking, or physically uncomfortable, but itshouldn\u2019t be too painful. You might feel discomfort andpossibly bleeda little becauseyour hymenmight tear a bit. Not everyone experiences this, though. There are plenty of things you can do tomake your first time as enjoyableas possible. Remember: sex should be fun and pleasurable, not painful!  Does it hurt the first time you have sex? You might have heard thatfirst-time sexis painful or uncomfortable but not be sure why. Well, it may come down to a few different factors. If you feel a little bit nervous before you have sex, then yourbody may tense up, making penetration more difficult and uncomfortable. One thing you might be worried about is thatyour partner\u2019s penis may be too bigor that it will hurt you. While this can sound daunting, try not to worry. This is possible, but it\u2019s very rare. Similarly, you might have heard the term \u201cpopping your cherry\u201d in relation to bleeding and discomfort during sex but not be sure what that means. Prepare for a bit of a biology lesson. Thehymenis athin, ring-like membrane that can partially or fully coverthe entrance of the vagina. Like other parts of your body,no two hymens are alike\u2014 they can vary in size, thickness, and elasticity. When the hymen is penetrated, it can stretch and tear, which can lead to a small amount of bleeding and discomfort. This isn\u2019t the same for everyone, though \u2014 your hymen may stretch or tear, and you may not notice at all. Sex isn\u2019t the only reason why your hymen might stretch. Other reasonsinclude: Using tampons or a menstrual cup Having a pelvic exam orPap smear Doing activities like swimming, cycling, playing football, and horse riding Masturbating What about experiencing pain after sex? Typically, people may experiencepain during sex very temporarily. This can be uncomfortable and scary, so if you\u2019re worried at any point, speak to your health care provider. They\u2019ll be able to guide you on the best next step. Other causes of painful sex Some medical conditions can make penetrative sex painful. Such as: Endometriosis Fibroids Vaginismus Ovarian cysts Vulvodynia Allergies Skin disorders Yeast infection Sexually transmitted infection (STI) Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) Pain during or after sex is often your body\u2019s way of telling yousomething\u2019s going on with it. It\u2019s understandable if you feel a bit embarrassed about it, but it\u2019s important to reach out to your doctor so they can figure out what\u2019s going on. Things to consider before having sex for the first time First-time sex can feel like a big deal even before you consider that it might be slightly uncomfortable. Here are sixtips you can considerwhen you\u2019re having sex for the first time. Discuss sex with your partner Ideally, it\u2019s best to talk about sex with your partnerbeforeyou do it. Discuss what you like and don\u2019t like, what you\u2019re willing to try, and plans for safer sex, e.g., what birth control method you will be using. Communication is the key to ensuring aconsensual and pleasurable experiencefor both of you. This might make you feel vulnerable, but it\u2019s so important that you\u2019re open with your partner beforehand about boundaries and protection. Warm up beforehand Spend timetouching and kissing each other\u2019s bodiesto ensure you\u2019re fully turned on. Part of yourbody\u2019s natural arousal response is vaginal lubrication, or \u201cgetting wet.\" Beingsufficiently wetreduces friction and makes penetration more pleasurable. You can alsouse lubeto make sex more comfortable. The amount of natural lubrication your body produces can bedifferent from experience to experience and person to person. \u201cWetness\u201d doesn\u2019tcorrelate to how arousedyou are or how into your partner you are. Lube can help you to avoid friction or dryness. Try different positions A painful first time could bedue to the position. If you feellike penetration is too deep, don\u2019t be afraid to switch things up. Set realistic expectations Many peoplehave high expectations for their first timeto be special and memorable. Some people have a mental checklist to determine when they\u2019re ready and plan where and when it will happen. These are reasonable things to do, but it\u2019s equally important to be realistic. Be fair to yourself and your partner, and try to be in the moment when it happens. There's no need to hurry: Take it slow Be patient with your partner and with yourself, and try not to take any thoughts about how you should feel too seriously. You may have expectations of yourself, your partner, and how things should go, but take a minute to relax. Find a pace and rhythm that suits you both \u2014 there\u2019s no need to rush. Communication is key: Voice how you\u2019re feeling The most important thing \u2014 whether it\u2019s your first time having sex or your hundredth time \u2014 is to ensureeveryone involved is consenting. Check in with each other before, during, and after sex to ensure you\u2019re both having a good time and are happy to keep going. No one should have to havesex that feels painfulor wrong, so if something doesn\u2019t feel good or you just change your mind and want to stop, you can and should tell your partner. Important safety precautions Aside from being enjoyable and pain-free, your first time should also be safe.Sex has many benefits, but it alsocomes with a few risks. Even if it\u2019s your first time, unprotected sex can lead tounwanted pregnancy and STIs, so it\u2019s important to use protection. Preventing STIs You can protect yourself and your partner from STIs and unwanted pregnancy byusing a condomand other methods of barrier contraception. Barrier methods (contraception that physically stops the sperm from reaching the egg) are the only form of contraception that can help prevent STIs. It might feel awkward and unfamiliar to broach the topic of contraception with a partner, but they should respect what you have to say. It\u2019s always okay to take things at your own pace, and you should never feel pressured into having sex without a condom, just like you shouldn\u2019t feel pressured to have sex at all. Preventing unwanted pregnancy It\u2019s a common myth thatyou can\u2019t get pregnant if it\u2019s your first time, but pregnancy can happenanytime you have unprotected sex, even if you\u2019reon your period(although it\u2019s unlikely). Condoms are a great way to prevent unwanted pregnancy, but thereare plenty more formsofbirth control. You can speak to your health care provider about the best type of birth control for you. Is pain during first-time sex a one-time thing? So, when does sex stop hurting? For many people,pain during sex is temporaryand becomes less and less uncomfortable over time. However,if you experience painevery time you have sex or you notice bleeding afterward, contact your health care provider. They may examine any other symptoms you have (such as abnormal discharge, dryness before or during sex, or potential allergies) and figure out the best next step for you."

        "title": "Signs your breasts are growing during puberty: Everything you need to know",
        "url": "https://flo.health/menstrual-cycle/teens/your-body/breast-development-puberty",
        "publication_date": "Updated12 April 2023|",
        "content": "Your teen years are full of pretty notable firsts \u2014 your first crush, maybeyour first kiss, andyour first period. This can all be very exciting, but theemotional and physical changesthat make up puberty might leave you with a few questions \u2014 namely, what\u2019s going on with your boobs? One of the earliest changes you might have noticed is that yourbreasts have started to growand change shape. For many people, puberty begins between the ages of8 and 13 years old, but your breastscontinue to develop well into adulthood. While this is to be expected and is something to be celebrated (boobs are great, after all), it\u2019s natural to feel self-conscious at times about the wayyour body is changing. You might find yourself looking at your friends and peers and wondering if you\u2019re \u201cnormal,\u201d for example. To reassure you, a Flo expert shares the lowdown on how your breastsmight change during puberty\u2014 including what isconsidered to be earlyorlate developmentand how to choose your first bra. What are the breast development stages during puberty? The changes youexperience during pubertymight feel overwhelming and hard to track. Between yourperiod startingand hairgrowing in new places, it\u2019s common to feel like you\u2019re living in a new, slightly unpredictable body. However, knowledge is power, and understanding what might happen and when may help you feel more in control. So, first up, what evenispuberty? It might come as no surprise that it has a lot to do with hormones. Puberty is triggeredwhen the hormone center of your brain\u2014 known as thehypothalamus \u2014 releaseshormones to start new processes. For example, follicle-stimulating hormonesandluteinizing hormonesact as a green light foryour ovaries to start producing the sex hormone estrogen, which plays a role in breast development. Estrogen triggers fatto collect in the chest areaaround age 10. However, this can happen a little earlier, so you may notice changes between the ages of 8 and 12. This means, from that point onward,breast buds start to formunder the nipple. Breast buds are small, disc-shaped bumpsthat might cause your nipples to stick out. They might appear like raised bumps initially and feel slightly sore, itchy, or uncomfortable \u2014 all of this is perfectly normal. The area around your nipple,called your areola, may also start to grow and darken in color. This is also totally expected and nothing to worry about. It\u2019s even a sign that you might be about to reach another big milestone. While they might not feel like they\u2019re connected, breast buds tend to formaround two years before your first period. So, if you start to notice your chest developing, you can prepare for your first menstrual bleed. To learn more about how your body may change during puberty, usean app like Flo. Tanner stages in girls: Female breast development scale When you think about your breasts developing, you might just imagine them gettingbigger, but there\u2019s a little more to it than that. While you might notice growth, your boobs can also change shape, and your nipple may change too. To understand this development, you can review thesexual maturity ratingor the five Tanner stages \u2014named after Professor James M. Tanner, a child development expert who was the first to identify andlabel the visible stages of puberty. Signs your breasts are growing You might have been waiting to spot the first signs of puberty, and you may be able to feel new developments before you see any differences. \u201cThe breast area can be tender or sore or itchy during breast growth,\u201d saysDr. Sara Ritchie, assistant professor of pediatrics at theMedical University of South Carolina, US.This is all totally normal and nothing to worry about. You might also see some changes in the skin around your boobs as they grow.Some people develop stretch markson their breasts, which may fade over time. If you feel at all self-conscious about stretch marks, remember that they\u2019re totally normal, lots of people have them, and they\u2019re just your body\u2019s way of helping you grow into the adult you\u2019re going to be. Are there nonphysical signs that breasts could be growing? You\u2019ll probably already be aware that puberty can affecthow you feelas well as how you look.Mood changes are a symptomthat many of us experience throughout our teen years and into adulthood. Again, this comes down to your hormones. While mood swings aren\u2019t a direct sign that your breasts are developing, theyarea big indicator that you\u2019ve hit puberty. To learn more about how your hormones can impact your mood during puberty, you can usean app like Flo. What do teen breasts look like? It can take a while to get your head around thechanges in the way your body looksand feels. Many of us don\u2019t have anyone to compare our own to, which means there\u2019s often curiosity around what breasts are supposed to look like and whether yours are \u201cnormal.\u201d The answer to this question is pretty straightforward. When it comes to the way boobs look, there\u2019s no such thing as normal. They\u2019re all awesome! Your breasts will grow, change in shape, and change size throughout your teen years, so try to embrace them however they look. \u201cIt can take about four years for the breasts to fully develop,\u201d saysDr. Ritchie.\u201cThe size may be uneven [but may balance] out over time. Many adults have slightly different-sized breasts,\u201d Dr. Ritchie adds. In fact,around one in four adultshave boobs that aren\u2019t exactly the same size and shape, so if this is the case for you, remember it\u2019s very typical. Your breasts willcontinue to develop until you\u2019re around 17 or 18years old, but that\u2019s not the end of their journey. Many fully grown adults will tell you that their boobs havechanged throughout adulthood. Keep reading to find out how. What is considered to be late or early development? As we mentioned, most people start puberty between the ages of8 and 13 years old. And, generally speaking, the earlier you start, the earlier you\u2019ll finish. But puberty can begin at different times for different people. So, while we know it can feel worrying if you\u2019re not at the same stage as your friends (whether you\u2019re the pioneering pal who is the first to wear a bra or if you\u2019re still waiting for that day to come), try not to worry. Your body is just going at its own pace. Some people start puberty earlier than average \u2014 before the age of 8 \u2014 and this is known asprecocious puberty. On the other hand,delayed pubertyis when things are happening more gradually, and youhaven\u2019t started to develop breastbuds by the age of 13. If you\u2019re worried about how quickly or slowly you\u2019re developing, then speak to an adult you trust or your doctor. It\u2019s very normal to have questions, and they\u2019ll be able to walk you through what might be happening. Can breasts continue growing into your 20s or 30s? This might come as a little bit of a surprise to you, but your breasts don\u2019t stop changing once you finish puberty. So let\u2019s break this down.Your boobs might change size in your twenties, thirties, and beyond if you lose or gain weight. This is because your boobs are partially made up of fatty breast tissue. If you lose weight, then you may lose it from your chest. Similarly, once you start your period each month, you\u2019ll experience a rise and fall in the hormones estrogen and progesterone. This is in line with your menstrual cycle.During their period, many peoplereport their breasts feeling different in texture \u2014 theymight feel firmer or lumpy. You\u2019ll know what\u2019s normal for you, so if you\u2019re ever worried about a change in the look or texture of your boobs, don\u2019t be afraid to reach out to your doctor. It might feel like a long way away, but pregnancy and breastfeeding are also big times of change for your body, including your breasts. When you\u2019re expecting a baby,your body releases a hormone called prolactin. This encourages your breasts to start to produce milk, changing their size and look. Pretty amazing, right? Can you have complications when your breasts are growing? Feeling tingling, itchiness, or tenderness around your boobs can feel unfamiliar, but generally, most people move through their teen years without complications related to their breast growth. If you are worried, you can always speak to an adult that you trust and your doctor. It might be a part of your body that feels private, but don\u2019t let that put you off \u2014 your doctor will be able to answer any of your questions and check for any changes. Remember, they\u2019ve seen everything before! It\u2019s also totally normal to have mixed feelings or emotions relating to your body developing during puberty. These can range from excitement or curiosity to feeling anxious or upset. You might have mixed feelings for lots of reasons. One reason why some people feel conflicted as their body changes is that they no longer feel like their gender identitymatches the sex they were assigned at birth\u2014 and that\u2019s normal too.Gender dysphoria describes this uneasethat your biological sex and gender identity don\u2019t match. If you\u2019ve experienced any distress or anxiety surrounding how your body is changing, then don\u2019t be afraid to speak to a trusted adult. This could be a family member, friend, or organizations likeTrans LifelineorSwitchboard. Remember, you don\u2019t have to navigate these feelings on your own. When should you see a doctor? While most people\u2019s boobs change throughout their teens and adulthood without complication, there are some signs you can look out for that may suggest it could be helpful to speak to your doctor. New aches and pains can be worrying, but there\u2019s no such thing as a silly question. These signs include: Severe pain, particularly if it\u2019s just on one side Redness on the skinof the breasts Nipple discharge Lack of development by thetime you are thirteen \u201cBreast masses\u201d or lumpsin the breasts How to choose a bra when you\u2019re a teenager Whenyour boobs start to grow, you\u2019ll likely be wondering when you can get your first bra. Buying your first bra might seem like a rite of passage and something everyone does. It\u2019s really important to remember that there\u2019s no right or wrong time to buy a bra. You\u2019ll knowhow your body is changing, and a bra may help you feel more comfortable. But if you\u2019re not ready yet and don\u2019t want to wear one, that\u2019s also totally fine. Talking this through with an adult you feel comfortable with \u2014 whether it\u2019s a friend or family member \u2014 before you go to the store might help you work through any nerves. It\u2019s natural for the underwear section to feel like an unknown land, but take someone with you for moral support, and you\u2019ll get familiar with the new world of bra shapes and cup sizes in no time. If going to the store feels embarrassing, then you can also shop for your first bra online. All you\u2019ll need is a tape measure so you can figure out what size you\u2019ll need. Wearing the right bra size is really important, as it can support your boobs as they grow and may ease any discomfort you have. You\u2019ll notice there are lots of different types of bras \u2014 from bralettes to underwire bras and sports bras. Each will feel different, and there\u2019s no \u201cright\u201d style for a first bra, so explore what feels best for you. Breast changes during puberty: The takeaway Like most parts of puberty, breast development can feel sudden and unpredictable. It\u2019s totally normal to have questions about what\u2019s going on with your body, and so, hopefully, now you feel more informed. The most important thing to remember is there\u2019s no such thing as normal when it comes to boobs. They can be different sizes and shapesat different points in your life, as they\u2019ll grow and change with you. So remember not to be hard on yourself, and instead, try to embrace the changes you\u2019re going through as your body develops."

        "title": "What is gaslighting? Definition, examples, and advice on dealing with it",
        "url": "https://flo.health/menstrual-cycle/teens/gaslighting",
        "publication_date": "Updated19 January 2023|",
        "content": "If you\u2019re a fan of romantic comedies or reality TV, you\u2019ll likely know the feeling of desperately wanting your favorite character to realize they\u2019re being manipulated by their partner. We\u2019ve all thought it:Girl, listen to your best friend and dump them already. Spotting the signs of emotional and mental abuse, of which gaslighting is one kind, can be easy when they\u2019re clearly laid out for us on screen. But they may not be as obvious when they crop up in real-life situations. You might not know what the definition of gaslighting is. Susan Masterson, Ph.D., licensed psychologist and Flo board member, Kentucky, US, explains the key thing to remember about what gaslighting means: \u201cIf you detect a pattern from someone who keeps making you feel likeyou\u2019re \u2018wrong\u2019 about thingsyou know to be true, you are probably being gaslit.\u201d But gaslighting behavior isn\u2019t always so clear-cut, making it pretty tough to spot at times. So what is the definition of gaslighting, and is it a bit more serious than social media sometimes makes it out to be? What is gaslighting? While you might have first heard the term on TikTok, the phrase \u201cgaslighting\u201d has actually been around since the mid-20th century \u2014 all thanks to a movie. Released in the United States in 1944 \u2014 with an earlier British version put out in 1940 \u2014the filmGaslightfollows a young woman whose husband manipulates her into madness. \u201cIn the movie, the husband did a number of things to convince his wife she was \u2018insane\u2019 so he could have her committed to a mental institution and keep her late aunt\u2019s riches,\u201d explainsMasterson. \u201cIt\u2019s used today to describe the process when someone says and does things to make you think what youknowto be true is \u2018in your head\u2019 or that things are your fault when they are, in fact, not.\u201d And while gaslighting in popular culture usually follows the same formula and appears between characters who are dating,Mastersonsays it can happen in any situation. \u201cGaslighting can happen in any type of relationship \u2014 be it with a partner, a friendship, or in a family setting \u2014 where someone wants to put theother person in a position of relative weaknessto keep them around or to control the dynamic,\u201d she explains. Typical behavior and signs of gaslighting The difficult thing about gaslighting is that it can range from incredibly subtle behaviors (like convincing you that something didn\u2019t happen when it did) to more obvious incidents. Masterson saysthere isn\u2019t a checklistof \u201ctypical\u201d signs, but there are some examples you might look out for. Gaslighting examples You might disagree with someone about a previous conversation. You\u2019re sure that they said something, but they\u2019ve changed their story now that they know they\u2019re in the wrong. This is gaslighting if the person is making you believe that your memory is wrong in order to manipulate or isolate you. During a heated discussion, someone tells you that your coworkers, friends, or family don\u2019t like you as much as you think they do. If they do this in an attempt to isolate you, then it can be considered gaslighting. They may even disguise it as telling you that it\u2019s \u201cfor your own good.\u201d The person you\u2019re dating touches you in a way that\u2019s too rough or inappropriate. You protest and ask them not to do it again, and they tell you to stop overreacting and to lighten up. A friend makes a joke at your expense. You ask them not to treat you like that, and they tell you that it was only a joke, and they weren\u2019t even talking about you. A partner, friend, or family member is physically aggressive toward you. When you push them away, they blame you for making them mad or jealous enough to do it. They make you feel responsible fortheirfeelings and behavior. Gaslighting is just one way that someone may try to control you. And it can often be used to justify other behavior, such asphysical harm, financial manipulation, or digital abuse. For example, someone might make you feel like yourfeelings aren\u2019t a priorityor that they\u2019re silly. They might make you feel like you can\u2019t do anything right or that you shouldn\u2019t see certain people. This is emotional abuse and is linked to gaslighting. Alternatively, you might feel like you\u2019re being controlledthrough your financesonce you start earning your own money. This could be in the form of being given an allowance, not being allowed to make certain purchases without asking permission, or having your paycheck deposited into someone else's account so you can\u2019t access it. Digital abuseis where someone might tell you who you can and can\u2019t follow or speak with on social media. It also includes someone using online or GPS technology to track your activities. Commonly asked questions about gaslighting So, it\u2019s pretty clear that gaslighting can look very different in each situation. But you might still be left with questions. Can someone gaslight you without them realizing it? If they say they didn\u2019t know they were upsetting you, then is it still wrong? And can gaslighting be considered as serious as abuse? Put simply, yes. And Masterson explains how below. Is unconscious gaslighting real? If someone is manipulating you, then it sounds calculated, right? Masterson explains it isn\u2019t always as simple as that. Unconscious, or unintentional, gaslighting is when aperson shows gaslighting behavior, often for their own gain, but doesn\u2019t realize that they are doing it. This might mean they make you feel guilty for doing something without them or saying that you shouldn\u2019t feel upset about something that they\u2019ve said or done. While they might not always recognize what they\u2019re doing is wrong or hurtful, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s OK. We know it can be difficult, but try to explain to them how their behavior is harming you. Outline that while they might not see it, the way they\u2019re making you feel isn\u2019t right and is really affecting you. Below, Masterson explains a few other things you can do if you think you\u2019re being gaslit. Is gaslighting a form of manipulation? Masterson says, \u201cYes, gaslighting can be defined as aform of manipulation.\u201d You might not think that gaslighting is a big deal or that it isn\u2019t as serious as manipulation, but they\u2019re the same thing and never acceptable. And is gaslighting considered abuse? Abuse may sound like a loaded term, but gaslighting is a form of psychological abuse. So what does thatreallymean? UK-based nonprofitSafeLives explains that psychological abusecan include: When someone regularly and intentionally uses their words and actions to scare or upset you When someone tries to control your actions or confuse you into not knowing what the truth is anymore When someone tries to break your confidence and change the way you see yourself by speaking down to you or humiliating you Being given the silent treatment during arguments, feeling like you can\u2019t hang out with certain friends or family members, being made to feel responsible for your partner\u2019s emotions and reactions, and being made to doubt your own memories and beliefs also all fall into this. It can be really jarring to attach the term \u201cabuse\u201d to your relationship. Many of us think it\u2019ll never happen to us, but you\u2019re never alone. Try to reach out to someone you trust and explain what you\u2019re going through. This might be as simple as running through some examples of their behavior and how it made you feel. Gaslighting in pop culture Now that you know what gaslighting means, you\u2019ll probably be able to pick out lots of examples in movies and TV. Films likeThe Girl on the Train, starring Emily Blunt, or Elizabeth Moss\u2019s 2020 thrillerThe Invisible Manall highlight gaslighting behavior from male partners. In the TV seriesHomeland, the main character, played by Claire Danes, experiences psychological manipulation. Dramatizations of real-life stories, like the 2018 Netflix seriesDirty John: The Betty Broderick Story, also show examples of gaslighting. And while it might not be spoken about as much, former child star Jeanette McCurdy opened up about the gaslighting behavior she experienced from her mother Debra in her memoirI\u2019m Glad My Mom Died, which was released in early 2022. Seeing other people go through something similar to you may feel comforting. It\u2019s one thing to read that you\u2019re not alone and another to see it in action. It might even help you recognize gaslighting. A previous situation might have felt bad, but you\u2019re not sure why. Seeing it played out on screen could confirm that your gut feeling was right and that you don\u2019t have to put up with manipulation. At the same time, if you find it difficult to watch or read about gaslighting because it feels too real or too close to your situation, then prioritize yourself and stay away from it. Remember that your safety and peace are the number one priority, and you know how best to heal and protect yourself. Are there any long-term gaslighting effects? Telling someone to walk away from their gaslighter feels like an easy solution, right? But being continually told that you\u2019re wrong or should feel bad can have very real, lasting effects on you. You might have totally lost trust in your own judgment after being gaslit. \u201cBeing unable to trust what you saw with your own eyes, heard with your own ears, and trust your instincts is damaging to your self-concept and can set you up for a pattern of repeating relationships with people who treat you this way,\u201d Masterson says. \u201cIf you\u2019re hearing it again from a new partner, you begin to think that it must be true, which is absolutely not the case.\u201d Gaslighting has been linked to a number of mental health conditions, including: Depression Anxiety Isolation and loneliness Post-traumatic stress disorder Self-doubt and insecurity What to do if you think you\u2019ve experienced gaslighting If you think you may have experienced or be experiencing gaslighting, dealing with the after-effects may seem a little daunting. However, it\u2019s so important to remember that you\u2019re not alone, and this absolutely isn\u2019t your fault. \u201cIf you\u2019re in this situation, it\u2019s worth distancing yourself from this person,\u201d Masterson says. \u201cTrying to change how they treat you will not work.\u201d The person who is gaslighting you may be really ingrained in your life. They could be at school or home, for example, and it might feel tricky to work out how to get that distance. But you aren't isolated, and there are people out there who are able to help. Reach out to someone you trust. This might be a friend, teacher, or parent. Talk to the person who feels safest to you. It could be a really great idea to start gathering evidence and building a case for yourself. That way, you\u2019re less likely to doubt yourself that there\u2019s gaslighting going on. Note down every time they do something that makes you second-guess yourself. Keep messages and pictures as proof. This might make it easier to remember individual incidents later. If you share a home, workspace, or school with the person causing you distress, the most important thing to consider is your safety. If you\u2019re worried about their behavior, then remember to erase your internet search history and keep any notes you\u2019re taking in a secure place. Give them to someone you trust or send them on and then delete them from your phone. And know that you don\u2019t have to suffer through this alone. And at any point, you can reach out to nonprofits or support groups for help. \u201cIn the United States, the number to call is1-800-799-SAFE (7233),\u201d says Masterson. If you feel like you\u2019re in danger or need help right away, then call 911 or your emergency services number (999 in the United Kingdom and 000 in Australia). In the United Kingdom, the nonprofitsWomen\u2019s AidandRefugesupport people who have experienced abuse in all its forms. You can call Refuge\u2019s free hotline at \u200b\u200b0808 2000 247. If you\u2019re based in Australia,Mission AustraliaandRizeUp Australiamay be able to give you more information and support. What is gaslighting? The takeaway Gaslighting is whensomeonesays or does things that make you questionwhat you know to be true. You might be made to believe that yourmemory is wrong or you\u2019re overreacting to someone else\u2019s actions. While you might have heard friends joke about being gaslit, it\u2019s actually a form of psychological abuse, and friends, the person you\u2019re dating, and even family members can present behavior that would be considered gaslighting. If you think you might be going through this, then it can feel incredibly isolating, but know you\u2019re not alone and aren\u2019t overreacting. Trust your gut and reach out to an adult that you trust."

        "content": "Let\u2019s face it: It\u2019s normal to feel a bitweird about puberty. It\u2019s all too easy to compare yourself to your peers and feellike your bodyis changing too much, too quickly, or too slowly. Knowing what to expect (and when) may make you feel more comfortable and confident as your body develops. Whilepubertycan look different for everyone, it generallystarts between the ages of 8 and 13, with10 being the average age to start puberty. It lasts, on average,around 5 years, although this can be different for everyone. During this time, you mightpick up on physical changesas well asdevelopments in your mood and emotions. To help you navigate this and answer all of your burning questions, two Flo experts give you thelowdown on puberty. What is puberty? You\u2019ll likely have heard the term puberty used in your health class. This is the name given tothe natural processof your body changing from a child to an adult. When you hear the word puberty, you might think ofyour period startingor your body changing, but these processesactually all start in the brainin a region called the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is the area of the brain that starts to release hormones that instruct other parts of your body to start growing and changing. These hormones arecalled follicle-stimulating hormonesandluteinizing hormones. They act as a green light for yourovaries, triggering the production of estrogen and progesterone. Among other things, these hormonesregulate your cycle(establishing when you release an egg, which is known as ovulation, and when you\u2019llhave your first period). You can learn all about your cycleusing an app like Flo. When does puberty start and end? As we now know, puberty can be slightly different for everyone, but for most girls and people assigned female at birth, this time of change begins between the ages of8 and 13 years old.Remember thehormones we mentioned earlier? Well, between the ages of9 and 10, you experience a surge in hormones in preparation for all the physical changes your body needs to make over the following few years.This is around two years earlier in girls than in boys. These physical changes you experience during puberty can hit at different times. However, generally, you\u2019ll notice these milestones: Your breasts will start to develop (this is called breast budding) Your pubic hair will grow You\u2019ll experience a growth spurt You\u2019ll have your first period You can learn more about the different stages of puberty below.Since puberty can be a little bit unpredictable, it\u2019s impossible to know exactly when puberty will start and end. While most peoplefinish puberty by 18, that\u2019s not the case for everyone. It\u2019s totally normal for your body to continue changing after that, and you might notice that some of yourpremenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptomsmimic what you\u2019ve experienced during puberty. 5 Tanner stages of puberty You might notice which of your friends is wearing a bra or shaving their legs to establish who hit puberty first, but there\u2019s also a scientific way to classify some of the physical changes you experience during puberty. It\u2019s calledthe Tanner stagesor thesexual maturity rating. Named after Professor James M. Tanner, a child development expert, the Tanner stages refer to the ways in which breasts, pubic hair, and male genitalia change during puberty. Your body changes in a number of ways during your teen years; they\u2019re not limited to your boobs and body hair. However, you might be able to relate to some of the Tanner stages. Tanner stages in females While the five Tanner stages might give you an idea of what to expect,it isn\u2019t a strict timeline, and you might experience these signsof puberty in a different order. It also isn\u2019t an exhaustive list of all the ways your body will change during puberty. You currently don\u2019t have any pubic hair. You don\u2019t have any visible breast growth or development. You start to develop soft, downy pubic hair. You might start tonotice breast budsforming under your nipple. They might appear like raised bumps. The pubic hair starts to grow. It might start to appear a little bit thicker and grow in patches. Your breast buds will continue to grow and may appear fuller or rounder. The pubic hair continues to grow and covers the vulva. Your breasts may appear fuller now, looking more like boobs rather than buds. Thearea around your nipple, called your areola, will also get bigger. The pubic hair covers your vulva and beyond. (You might notice hair in the crease of your inner thighs or down the insides of your legs.) Your breasts will continue to grow and change shape. Most people notice that their boobs change throughout their adult life \u2014 this isn\u2019t something that stops at puberty. Changes to your body during puberty The physical changes listed above aren\u2019t the only developments you\u2019ll notice during your teen years. Knowing what you could expect can help you feel in control. So let\u2019s dig into those first physical signs of puberty. Breast development It might feel like your boobs appeared overnight, but as we now know, this process starts quite gradually, withbreast buds being the first signthat you\u2019ve started puberty. Your breasts will take a few years to fully develop, and it\u2019s important to remember that they come in all shapes and sizes. One may be larger than the other, your boobs might feel sore and tender as they grow, or they may be slightly different shapes, and that\u2019s OK: all bodies are beautiful! Finding a supportive bra may ease any growing pains. Body hair As the Tanner stages suggest, your pubic hair will grow and may change in texture as you move through your teen years. Puberty alsocauses hair growth in your armpitsas well as on your legs and arms.Everyone has it, so don\u2019t feel ashamed.Whether you want to keep or remove it is completely up to you \u2014there\u2019s no medical or hygienic benefit to getting rid of it. Changing body shape and height During puberty,you\u2019ll have a growth spurt and get taller, your hips will get wider, and your breasts will start to develop, meaning you might look a little curvier. You might feel like you\u2019re coming out of puberty in an entirely different body than you started, but try to embrace it if you can, as this is totally normal. Periods Waiting for your period to start can feel daunting, especially if your friends have already had their first one. Generally,you\u2019ll have your first period a couple of yearsafter you\u2019ve started puberty, which is why it happens at different times for everyone. Your period iswhen the lining of your uterusbreaks down and flows out of your vagina, and it\u2019s nothing to be scared of. It might feel like you\u2019re losing a lot of blood, but on average, you only losebetween 1 and 5 tablespoonsof blood per period. You can learn all about your period and predict when it will happenusing an app like Flo. Other physical changes Your first period might feel like the biggest milestone of puberty, but it\u2019s among a number of other physical changes that aren\u2019t touched upon in the Tanner stages. Vaginal discharge Discharge is awhite or clear fluid that you might noticeon your underwear, and while it might be confusing to see at first, it\u2019s perfectly normal. Discharge, which is also known ascervical mucus, starts toappear during pubertyand is there to keep your vagina healthy. Most women and people who menstruate have some discharge every day, but if itstarts to bother youin any way or your vagina becomes sore or itchy, or you notice a change in the color or smell of your discharge, then it\u2019s definitely worth talking to your doctor about. Spots and acne Acne is triggered by puberty hormonesas your skin becomes more oily and your pores can become clogged, so it\u2019s common to get pimples on your face (or other parts of your body, like your back). That doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t suck, though! You might find yourself feeling a little self-conscious about acne, but remember that it\u2019s very common throughout your teenage years, and chat with your doctor if you\u2019re worried. The good news? There are lots oftreatments that can help. Sweating It\u2019s inconvenient, but it\u2019s a fact of life: Puberty causes you to sweat more. You canreduce your chances of having body odorby wearing deodorant, washing more, and wearing loose-fitting clothing. And if you\u2019re feeling really self-conscious about the way you smell, then speak to a trusted adult about what you might be able to do to improve things. Navigating the way your body is changing can feel like uncharted waters. Your body is becoming more adult, and that\u2019s what\u2019s supposed to happen, but growing up can still feel strange and awkward sometimes. It\u2019s natural to feel uncertain and self-conscious during puberty. If you have any questions, then reach out to an adult you trust; this could be a parent, teacher, sibling, or friend. And remember that while puberty can be uncomfortable, you\u2019re growing into the adult you\u2019ll become \u2014 and that\u2019s pretty wonderful. Internal changes As your body is changing on the outside, you\u2019re alsochanging on the inside. Your reproductive organs \u2014 such as your uterus, uterine tubes, ovaries, and vagina, grow and elongate as you move through your teen years. You might not be totally sure what each of these parts does, and that\u2019s totally normal. You canlearn all about your vulva here. Emotional changes Puberty doesn\u2019t just impact the way you look \u2014 emotional changes are just as important. As your body produces hormones,you may experience ups and downsor mood swings. This is all part of puberty, but if you\u2019re worried or feel depressed, speak to a doctor. You can alsouse an app like Floto fully understand what\u2019s happening with your hormones at this time. It\u2019s also worth remembering that puberty also brings about lots of exciting feelings:having your first crush, succeeding at school, and getting closer to friends. Your teen years are full of a lot of amazing firsts, so embrace the highs as well as the lows and remember it\u2019s all part of growing up. What affects the duration of puberty? While puberty is something we all go through at some point during our teens, lots of things can affect how long it lasts. \u201cThere are ahuge number of variablesthat impact the start time and duration of puberty,\u201dexplains Dr.Katie Blundell, a pediatrician at London\u2019s Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, United Kingdom. \u201cThese include your gender, ethnicity, genetics, nutrition, and physical activity.\u201d Studies have highlighted that ifyou\u2019re Black or Hispanic, you may start puberty a little bit earlier (around seven and a half years old rather than eight). Similarly, links have been made betweenchildhood body size and an earlier onset of puberty. While all of these factors might give you a better chance atguessing when you\u2019ll noticethe telltale signs of puberty,Dr. Sara Ritchie, assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of South Carolina, United States, says there\u2019s one key factor that might unlock some answers for you.\u201cIn general, your personal genetics are the most important factor in the timing of puberty,\u201d she says. So, if you feel comfortable, it might be best to ask a family member when they started to see a change. When to see a doctor Although it can feel uncomfortable and sometimes a bit embarrassing, puberty is a totally natural process. \u201cIf you think anything you\u2019re experiencing is unusual, don\u2019t worry about speaking to a doctor or other health professional,\u201d says Dr. Blundell. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen it all before and are happy to check whether anything might be abnormal.\u201d Remember that the average ageto start puberty is 10, but this can vary for different people. You might be worried that you haven\u2019t seen as many physical changes as you thought you would have, but rest assured that it\u2019s incredibly rare not to hit puberty at all. If you haven\u2019t noticed thefirst signsof your breasts developing bythe age of 13and if your period hasn\u2019t started by the age of 15, then it may be a good idea to reach out to your doctor. This may be considered to be delayed puberty. Answering the internet\u2019s most asked questions about puberty If any aspect of puberty has ever left you feeling stumped and you\u2019ve found yourself turning to the internet, then you\u2019re not alone. The web is teaming with questions all centered around what is going on. So we thought we\u2019d answer some of the most common queries. How can I determine what stage of puberty I\u2019m at? The Tanner stages of puberty may give you an indication, or you can look at trusted websiteslike The American College of Obstetricians and GynecologistsorNHS. Does puberty end at 18? Most peoplefinish puberty by the age of 18, but that\u2019s not the case for everyone. It\u2019s totally normal for your body to continue changing after that. At what age do you fully hit puberty? Puberty is a years-long process, so there isn\u2019t an exact time when you fully hit it. As we mentioned earlier, you might start puberty earlier or later than your friends, and that\u2019s totally normal. Stages of puberty: The takeaway Puberty is different for everyone. It might feel like you\u2019re tackling mood changes one week and your first period in the next. While this can be a time of daunting firsts, there\u2019s also a lot of excitement to look forward to in your teen years. You mayhave your first kiss, start to make big decisions about your future, and make friends you\u2019ll have for life. Puberty is a natural process that\u2019s part of growing up, but that doesn\u2019t mean that coping with a rapidly changing body isn\u2019t challenging at times. Try to be compassionate toward yourself, and if you have any questions or worries, then don\u2019t be embarrassed to speak to an adult you trust. They\u2019ve been in your shoes."
